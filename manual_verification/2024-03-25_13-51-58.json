  "llm_response": "When valuing a church in downtown Toronto, the most suitable approach to consider would be the Cost Approach. This approach is particularly useful for valuing unique properties like public and religious-use properties. The Cost Approach provides a value indication based on the estimated land value plus the depreciated cost of the building and other improvements. Since churches are often unique buildings with special features and characteristics, the Cost Approach can help provide a reliable indication of the market value by considering the cost of building reproduction and appropriate depreciation estimates."
