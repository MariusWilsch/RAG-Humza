  "llm_response": "To calculate the Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM), you need to divide the sales price of a property by its gross monthly unfurnished rental income. The formula is:\n\n$$ GRM = \\frac{Sales Price}{Gross Rent} $$\n\nTo establish an accurate GRM for appraisal purposes, it is recommended to have recent sales and rental data from at least three properties similar to the subject property. Additionally, obtaining and evaluating data on at least ten comparable rental sales is advised for more accuracy, especially in areas with a high percentage of rentals."
