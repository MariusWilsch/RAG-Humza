The appraiser should note the condominium and/or management association that cares for common areas, the amount of monthly fees or other assess- ments charged, and any special facilities provided (such as a tennis\n\ncourt or swimming pool).\n\nAppraisers generally use the sales comparison approach to value individual condominium units. In areas of high population density, well-designed and well-maintained residential condominiums have appreciated in value, though typically not as much as detached homes, if those are available. If a surfeit of building has resulted in more condominiums than the available demand has warranted, prices will decrease to reflect the reduced demand. When a substantial number of condominium units are owned for rental investment purposes, main- tenance may be more difficult, particularly if absentee landlords are slow in paying homeowner assessments. Investors contributed to the run-up of property prices in many areas, particularly in Florida.\n\nIn Document 7_WeakPDF_2008 Fundamentals Of Real Estate Appraisal 10th Ed.pdf in page 121:\n\nMultiunit Buildings\n\nIn appraising a multiunit residential building, the appraiser recor the building data in the same way as for a single-family house, excep f;t multiunit building will have more information to evaluate, possibl in many categories. If apartment and room sizes are standard, thi work will be greatly simplified. If there are units of many differe sizes, however, each apartment must be recorded. In such a case, floor-by-floor room breakdown would not be as useful as an apai ment-by-apartment breakdown. Because most multiunit apartments are standardized, a typical floor plan that indicates the size, place ment, and layout of the apartments would be the easiest and best wa to show them.\n\nThere are some physical features that an appraiser may not b able to learn about a house or apartment building without breaking into walls, but if a checklist of items to be inspected, such as those Figure 8.4, is prepared in advance, most of the building\u2019s deficiencie; as well as its special features can be identified.

  "llm_response": "To begin the appraisal process for your condo with 50 square meters and two bedrooms in the middle of the city, the appraiser would typically use the sales comparison approach to value individual condominium units. This approach involves comparing your condo to similar properties that have recently sold in the same area to determine an estimated value. \n\nIn the case of a condominium, special appraisal considerations include specifying both private and public areas, noting the exact location of the subject property within the building or site, and considering the upkeep of both public areas and other units. The appraiser would also need to take into account the condominium or management association that cares for common areas, monthly fees or assessments charged, and any special facilities provided.\n\nIt's important to provide the appraiser with all relevant information about your condo, such as the exact square footage, number of bedrooms, any special features or amenities, and the overall condition of the property. This information will help the appraiser accurately assess the value of your condo in the middle of the city."
