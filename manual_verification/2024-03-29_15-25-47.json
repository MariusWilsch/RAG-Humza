  "llm_response": "An ex parte proceeding is a legal procedure where only one party is represented, without the presence or notification of the other party. This means that one side presents their case to the court without the opposing party being involved or notified. An example of an ex parte proceeding is a request for a search warrant where the subject of the search is not informed or present during the hearing."
