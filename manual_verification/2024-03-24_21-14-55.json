  "llm_response": "I'm sorry, but the context provided does not contain specific formulas to show you. It mainly discusses the importance of understanding the derivation and structure of formulas in real estate mathematics, rather than just memorizing them as recipes. If you have any other questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!"
