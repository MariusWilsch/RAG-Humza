  "llm_response": "The Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM) formula is a useful tool in real estate appraisal to quickly estimate the value of a property based on its rental income. It is calculated by dividing the property's sales price by its gross monthly rental income. \n\nOne of the main reasons someone should use the GRM formula is that it provides a simple and straightforward way to assess the value of a property based on its income potential. This can be particularly helpful in situations where there is a lack of comparable sales data or when a quick estimate is needed.\n\nFor example, if you have three properties with recent sales and rental data similar to the subject property, you can calculate the GRM for each property and use that information to estimate the value of the subject property based on its rental income."
