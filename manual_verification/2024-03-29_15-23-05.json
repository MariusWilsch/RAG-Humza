  "llm_response": "An \"Ex Parte Proceeding\" is a legal procedure where only one party is represented. This means that the other party involved is not notified of the proceeding and is not present at the hearing. It differs from an adversary system or adversary proceeding, where both sides are represented and have the opportunity to present their case. \n\nFor example, a request for a search warrant is considered an ex parte proceeding because the person subject to the search is not informed of the proceeding and does not participate in the hearing."
