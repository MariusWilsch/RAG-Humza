  "llm_response": "A preliminary hearing, also known as an arraignment, is a legal proceeding where a magistrate or judge reviews the evidence presented by the prosecution to determine if there is enough evidence to proceed to trial. It is held to decide whether there is probable cause to believe that the accused committed the crime. During this hearing, the accused may enter a plea and the judge may also decide on bail conditions. An example of a preliminary hearing would be one held in a criminal case to determine if there is sufficient evidence to proceed with a trial for the defendant."
