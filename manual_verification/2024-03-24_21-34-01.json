  "llm_response": "The Hoskold formula is used in real estate appraisal to evaluate declining income streams. It specifically works for certain declining income streams where the income decline can be attributed to interest losses resulting from investing in a substandard sinking fund at a rate lower than the discount rate. The formula involves a constant income stream at a certain level minus the interest losses in the safe sinking fund. This method is suitable for situations where the income decline can be linked to the hypothetical capital recovery sinking fund using a substandard rate."
