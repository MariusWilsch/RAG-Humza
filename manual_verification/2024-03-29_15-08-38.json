  "llm_response": "In legal terminology, actions are considered \"transitory\" when they could have occurred anywhere, as opposed to \"local\" actions which are specific to a particular place. For example, a contract dispute between parties from different states would be considered transitory because it could have taken place in any jurisdiction where the parties have connections."
