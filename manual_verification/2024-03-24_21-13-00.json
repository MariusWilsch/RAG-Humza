List the income information in statement form, then compute the estimated potential gross income.\n\nApartment rental income is $96,000. Outlay for janitorial service is\n\n$14,700, with another $1,700 for supplies. Utilities are $10,600, and main- tenance and repairs amount to about $3,000. Taxes are $5,700. Income from washers and dryers is $1,900. Building depreciation is estimated at $4,500 per year. Rental spaces in the adjacent parking lot bring in $5,400 per year.\n\nIn Document 7_WeakPDF_2008 Fundamentals Of Real Estate Appraisal 10th Ed.pdf in page 275:\n\nExercise 15.3\n\nThe income capitalization and cost approaches will be most important valuing the subject property. The cost approach will set the upper limit of value, as there is land available for similar construction. The income capitalization approach is important because of the property\u2019s income-producing abilities and potential. The value reached by the income capitalization approach will be influenced by the existence of major tenants, who may be financially sound but who also may benefit from long-term contracts which may not reflect the recent dramatic increases in property values in the area.\n\nIn Document 2_Appraisal Methods.pdf in page 32:\n\n$150,000 \u00f7 $20,000 =\n\n7 .5 GIM\n\nConvert gross income into an indication of value using the GIM developed in the previous example:\n\nGross income attributable to subject $ 21,450\n\nIndicated GIM\n\n7 .5\n\nValue indication (7 .5 \u00d7 $21,450) $161,000 (rounded)\n\nSummary\n\nAlways consider using the income approach to appraise income-producing properties . This approach is based on the principle of anticipation\u2014that market value is equal to the present worth of anticipated future benefits of ownership . Income-producing property is purchased for the right to receive the future income stream of that property . You must evaluate this income stream in terms of quantity, quality, and duration, then convert it by means of an appropriate capitalization rate into an estimate of market value . Take care that the rent, expenses, and rates reflect those expected by the typical investor for the type of property being valued .\n\nNew user question: How do I carry out the income approach for a condo?\n\n",
  "llm_response": "The income approach for a condo involves evaluating the property based on its income-producing potential. This approach is commonly used for rental properties, including condos. To carry out the income approach for a condo, you would typically follow these steps:\n\n1. Estimate the potential rental income: Determine the potential rental income the condo could generate based on market rates for similar properties in the area.\n\n2. Consider expenses: Take into account all expenses associated with owning and renting out the condo, such as property taxes, maintenance costs, utilities, insurance, and any property management fees.\n\n3. Calculate the net operating income (NOI): Subtract the total expenses from the potential rental income to calculate the NOI.\n\n4. Determine the capitalization rate: The capitalization rate is used to convert the NOI into an estimate of the property's value. It is typically based on market data and the perceived risk associated with the investment.\n\n5. Calculate the property value: Divide the NOI by the capitalization rate to determine the estimated value of the condo based on its income-generating potential.\n\nBy following these steps and considering the specific income and expense details of the condo, you can carry out the income approach to determine its value as an income-producing property."
