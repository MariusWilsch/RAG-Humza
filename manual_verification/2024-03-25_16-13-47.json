  "llm_response": "A class action is a type of lawsuit where one or more persons sue on behalf of a larger group who have similar legal claims. It allows for multiple individuals with similar grievances to collectively bring their case to court, streamlining the legal process and ensuring efficient resolution for all members of the class. An example of a class action could be a group of consumers suing a company for false advertising."
