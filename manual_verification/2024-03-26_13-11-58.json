  "llm_response": "Cost data for real estate appraisal can be obtained from various sources. One common source is direct costs, which include labor, materials, equipment, and subcontractors fees. Indirect costs, such as profit and overhead, architect's fees, survey, legal fees, permits, licenses, insurance, taxes, financing charges, and selling expenses, are also important components of cost data. Additionally, depreciation data related to physical deterioration, including curable and incurable physical deterioration, can provide valuable insights into the cost considerations for real estate appraisal."
