  "llm_response": "When a witness incriminates themselves, it is referred to as \"self-incrimination.\" This occurs when a witness provides evidence or testimony that tends to implicate themselves in a crime or wrongdoing. For example, if a witness admits to committing a crime while testifying in court, they are self-incriminating."
