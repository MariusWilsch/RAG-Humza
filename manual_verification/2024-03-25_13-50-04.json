  "llm_response": "To reconstruct reported expenses, you need to adjust the operating expenses and reserves for replacements to derive the Net Operating Income (NOI). This involves eliminating inapplicable expense items for appraisal purposes and adjusting the remaining valid expenses. Then, subtract the adjusted expenses from the Effective Gross Income (EGI) to calculate the NOI.\n\nHere's an example of the Reconstruction of Reported Expenses:\n\nEffective Gross Income (EGI): $47,250\nOperating Expenses:\n- Insurance: $2,400\n- Taxes (in cap rate): $0\n- Management: $1,800\n- Utilities (tenant pays all): $375\n- Debt service (personal): $0\n- Repairs and maintenance: $2,250\n- Miscellaneous: $750\n\nTotal Adjusted Expenses: $29,575\nNet Income after adjustments: $17,675\n\nReserves for Replacement:\n- Roof cover (prorated): $300\n- HVAC (prorated): $340\n\nTotal Adjusted Expenses with Reserves: $8,215\nNet Income after adjustments and reserves: $39,035\n\nDifference between Reported and Reconstructed Expenses: $21,360\nPercentage Difference: 54.7%\n\nBy following this process, you can accurately reconstruct reported expenses to determine the Net Operating Income in real estate appraisal."
