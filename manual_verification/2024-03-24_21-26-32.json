  "llm_response": "To calculate the Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM), you need to divide the sales price of a property by its gross monthly rental income. The formula for GRM is as follows:\n\n$$ GRM = \\frac{Sales \\ Price}{Gross \\ Monthly \\ Rental \\ Income} $$\n\nTo establish an accurate GRM for appraisal purposes, it is recommended to have recent sales and rental data from at least three properties similar to the subject property. Additionally, to derive a more precise GRM, the appraiser should aim to evaluate data on at least ten comparable rental sales, especially in areas with a high percentage of rentals."
