It is the most reliable approach for valuing unique properties . The cost approach provides a value indication that is the sum of the estimated land value, plus the depreciated cost of the building and other improvements .\n\nThe total cost of constructing a new building today frequently sets the upper limit of value, assuming the building is the highest and best use for the land . The cost approach produces a reliable indication of market value when a sound building replacement or reproduction cost estimate is coupled with appropriate accrued depreciation estimates .\n\nIn Document 7_WeakPDF_2008 Fundamentals Of Real Estate Appraisal 10th Ed.pdf in page 216:\n\nThe Cost Approach\n\nThe basic unit cost used to arrive at reproduction or replacement cost must be explained. Two buildings are seldom if ever identical, so a square-foot cost or a cubic-foot cost taken from known cost data is almost always subject to some adjustment. The measurement of depre- ciation resulting from physical wear and tear, layout and design, and neighborhood defects must also be explained.\n\nNew user question: When should we use the cost approach\n\n",
  "llm_response": "The cost approach is most commonly used to appraise unique properties where there may not be comparable sales data available, or when the property is new and has not yet generated income. It is particularly reliable for valuing properties with special characteristics that make them different from others in the market. The cost approach is based on the principle that a buyer would not pay more for a property than it would cost to build an equivalent property. Therefore, it is recommended to use the cost approach when evaluating properties with these characteristics."
