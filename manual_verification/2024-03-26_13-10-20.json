Two buildings are seldom if ever identical, so a square-foot cost or a cubic-foot cost taken from known cost data is almost always subject to some adjustment. The measurement of depre- ciation resulting from physical wear and tear, layout and design, and neighborhood defects must also be explained.\n\nNew user question: What is a cost approach?\n\n",
  "llm_response": "The cost approach is a method used in real estate appraisal to determine the value of a property by considering the cost of replacing or reproducing the property's improvements, along with the estimated land value. It is particularly useful for valuing unique properties where there may not be comparable sales data available. The cost approach involves estimating the land value, depreciated cost of the building and other improvements, and any accrued depreciation. The total cost of constructing a new building sets the upper limit of value in this approach. Adjustments are typically made to account for differences between properties and to consider various forms of depreciation."
