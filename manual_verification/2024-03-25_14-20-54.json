  "llm_response": "In real estate appraisal, some important formulas to know include the direct capitalization formulas for calculating property values, the mortgage coefficient method for determining investment yield and capitalization rate, as well as formulas for equity techniques and purchase and leaseback problems. Familiarity with tables for varying interest rates, like the Inwood annuity table and reversion table, is also beneficial. These formulas and techniques are essential for accurately valuing different types of real estate properties."
