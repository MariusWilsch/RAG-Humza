While it primarily focuses on brain injuries, it also addresses conditions affecting the spinal cord and peripheral nervous system. The goal is to optimize recovery and improve a patient's functional abilities, including motor skills, speech and language, cognition, and emotional well-being [2].\n\nKey Components of Neurorehabilitation\n\nMedical Evaluation: A thorough assessment of the patient's neurological condition, physical capabilities, and cognitive function is essential. This evaluation helps determine the appropriate course of treatment. Physical Therapy: Physical therapists work on improving mobility, strength, balance, and coordination. They use exercises, gait training, and assistive devices to help patients regain their independence. Occupational Therapy: Occupational therapists focus on enhancing daily living skills, such as dressing, cooking, and bathing. They also address cognitive impairments and work on strategies to improve memory and problem-solving [3].\n\nIn Document neurorehab.pdf in page 18:\n\nSECTION 1\n\nGeneral aspects of neurorehabilitation\n\nIn Document 5-NeuroRehabilitation-A-Multidisciplinary-Approach.pdf in page 37:\n\n20\n\nNeuro-Rehabilitation : A multi disciplinary approach\n\nIn Document 5-NeuroRehabilitation-A-Multidisciplinary-Approach.pdf in page 163:\n\n146\n\nNeuro-Rehabilitation : A multi disciplinary approach\n\nNew user question: Tell me about the scope of The Scope of Neurorehabilitation\n\n",
