  "llm_response": "In legal terms, a witness incriminates themselves when their testimony or statements implicate themselves in a crime. This can happen when a witness provides information that suggests their own involvement in illegal activities. An example of self-incrimination would be if a witness admits to committing a crime during their testimony in court."
