  "llm_response": "The term for when a child of a person receives nothing from a will is \"pretermitted heir.\" This refers to a child who is not mentioned or provided for in a will executed by their parent, giving them the right to claim their share as an heir under the laws of distribution and descent. This situation typically arises when the parent unintentionally omits the child from the will."
