A capitalization rate can also be developed by breaking down the rate\u2019s component parts and estimat- ing each separately. The rate developed will be composed of recapture rate (return of investment) and inferest rate (return on investment). The recapture rate is often derived by using the straight-line metbod. The interest rate is developed by using the market extraction method.\n\nThe band of investment method takes into account both the rate required by the lender (called the mortgage constant) and the rate necessary for the equity investor\u2019s desired pretax cash flow (called the equity capitalization rate). An investment with a high degree of risk will have a corresponding high capitalization rate, resulting in a low property value. A low-risk investment will have a corresponding low capitalization rate and high value.\n\nIn Document 7_WeakPDF_2008 Fundamentals Of Real Estate Appraisal 10th Ed.pdf in page 196:\n\n/i CAPITALIZATION RATE\n\nIncome-producing property is usually bought as an investment. The investor will expect the property to provide both a return on the investment (profit on the amount invested) and a return of the invest- ment (the amount invested). The rate of return the investor in real estate receives is the capitalization rate (also called the overall capi- talization rate), which can be expressed as a relationship between the annual net operating income a property produces and its value. In equation form, it can be expressed as follows:\n\nUsing yield capitalization, the appraiser estimates that the property may be expected to produce in the future and th estimates the present worth of the right to receive that income:\n\nNet operating income = Capitalization rate or L.

  "llm_response": "The capitalization rate (CR) derivation involves calculating the rate of return that an investor in real estate expects to receive. It is a fundamental concept in real estate appraisal used to determine the value of income-producing properties. The capitalization rate can be expressed as the relationship between the property's annual net operating income (NOI) and its value (V) or selling price (SP). \n\nThe formula for calculating the capitalization rate is:\n\n$CR = \\frac{NOI}{V (or SP)} = \\frac{EGI-Opex}{V (or SP)}$\n\nAdditionally, the capitalization rate can be further broken down into its component parts, which include the recapture rate (return of investment) and the interest rate (return on investment). The recapture rate is often derived using the straight-line method, while the interest rate is developed using the market extraction method.\n\nIn summary, the capitalization rate derivation is a crucial step in real estate appraisal as it helps investors and appraisers assess the rate of return on their investment in income-producing properties."
