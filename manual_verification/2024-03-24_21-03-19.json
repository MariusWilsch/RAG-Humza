Two buildings are seldom if ever identical, so a square-foot cost or a cubic-foot cost taken from known cost data is almost always subject to some adjustment. The measurement of depre- ciation resulting from physical wear and tear, layout and design, and neighborhood defects must also be explained.\n\nNew user question: What is a cost approach?\n\n",
  "llm_response": "The cost approach is a method used to appraise all types of improved property, especially unique properties. It involves estimating the value of a property by summing the estimated land value with the depreciated cost of the building and other improvements. This approach is considered reliable, particularly when coupled with sound building replacement or reproduction cost estimates and appropriate accrued depreciation estimates."
