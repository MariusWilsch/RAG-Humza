  "llm_response": "In the legal context, a witness can incriminate themselves by providing testimony that directly implicates them in a crime or unlawful activity. This can happen if the witness admits to their own involvement in the illegal actions during their testimony. For example, if a witness on the stand admits to being present at the scene of a crime, they are essentially incriminating themselves. It's important for witnesses to be cautious and seek legal advice if they believe their testimony may lead to self-incrimination."
