  "llm_response": "In legal terms, a witness can be incriminated if their testimony contradicts their previous statements or if they provide information that implicates themselves or others in illegal activities. For example, if a witness admits to perjuring themselves on the stand, this could incriminate them. It's important for witnesses to be truthful and consistent in their testimony to avoid incrimination."
