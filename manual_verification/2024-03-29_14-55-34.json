  "llm_response": "Ex post facto refers to laws that permit conviction and punishment for a lawful act performed before the law was changed and the act made illegal. These types of laws are prohibited by the Constitution. For example, if a law is passed making a previously legal action illegal and then individuals are punished for engaging in that action before the law was changed, it would be considered ex post facto."
