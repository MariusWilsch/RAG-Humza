  "llm_response": "Communications are deemed confidential when they fall under the category of privileged communications in the legal context. These communications are protected by law against any disclosure, including forced disclosure in legal proceedings. They are typically confidential to maintain trust and encourage open communication in certain relationships, such as those between a lawyer and client, physician and patient, psychotherapist and patient, or priest, minister, or rabbi and penitent. The purpose of this privilege is to ensure individuals can freely communicate with these professionals without fear of their discussions being disclosed without consent."
