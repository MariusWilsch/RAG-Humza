Witnesses must be summoned to a German court for examination.

Such statements are the most common form of discovery, and may be taken of any witness, whether or not a party to the action. Parties to an action may be required to give witness testimony under the same rules as any non- party witness.

  "llm_response": "In civil or commercial matters, a witness may be found guilty of perjury if they knowingly provide false testimony while under oath. This is a serious offense that undermines the integrity of the judicial process. For example, if a witness in a civil case provides false information during a deposition, they could be held accountable for perjury. It is essential for witnesses to provide truthful and accurate information when testifying to ensure the fairness and reliability of the legal proceedings."
