  "llm_response": "In legal terms, a theft is typically considered a petty theft when the value of the stolen property is usually below $100.00. This threshold may vary slightly depending on the jurisdiction, but generally, petty theft involves taking and carrying away personal property of a relatively low value with the intent to permanently deprive the owner of it. For example, if someone steals an item worth $90.00 with the intention of keeping it for themselves, it would likely be classified as a petty theft."
