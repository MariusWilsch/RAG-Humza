  "llm_response": "In the legal context, communications are deemed confidential when they fall under the category of privileged communications. Privileged communications are protected by law against any disclosure, including forced disclosure in legal proceedings. These confidential communications typically occur between specific professionals and their clients or patients, such as lawyers and clients, physicians and patients, psychotherapists and patients, or religious figures and penitents. The purpose of ensuring confidentiality in these communications is to promote trust and openness in these professional relationships, allowing individuals to freely disclose information without fear of it being disclosed without their consent."
