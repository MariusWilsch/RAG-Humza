  "llm_response": "In the context of law, probate refers to the court-supervised process of determining the validity of a will and overseeing the distribution of the deceased person's assets to the designated beneficiaries. It involves confirming the appointment of the personal representative of the estate, gathering assets, paying debts and taxes, and distributing the remaining assets. Probate court is the specific court responsible for supervising estate administration, while a probate estate consists of the property that can be distributed according to the terms of a will. It's important to understand the probate process, the role of the probate court, and the implications of probate on estate distribution. An example could be when a person passes away and leaves a will, the probate process ensures that the assets are distributed according to the deceased person's wishes as outlined in the will."
