  "llm_response": "In legal terms, \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" is the standard of proof required for a juror to find a criminal defendant guilty. This means that the guilt of the accused must be proven to the extent that there is no reasonable doubt in the minds of the jury regarding the truth of the charge. If there is any lingering uncertainty or hesitation that prevents the jurors from having a firm conviction of the defendant's guilt, then the accused is entitled to acquittal. This standard is crucial in criminal cases to ensure that the accused is not convicted based on mere suspicion or insufficient evidence."
