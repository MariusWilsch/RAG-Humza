The brain is, however, very adaptable and, with the correct physiotherapy input, recovery can take place over a period of years. People often witness a rapid recovery in the first few weeks following a TBI, followed by a slower recovery over the following years.\n\nTo gain the maximum recovery, physiotherapy should be continued until patient's full potential has been reached. With the correct physiotherapy input and advice patient has lot of potential to long term improvements regaining as much movement and function over the years.\n\nIn Document 5-NeuroRehabilitation-A-Multidisciplinary-Approach.pdf in page 230:\n\nPSYCHOLOGICAL REHABILITATION POST TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY:\n\nGoals:\n\nThe goals for individuals post traumatic brain injury are to improve the person's ability to function by enhancing his or her capacity to organise the daily activities, to attend to and process information and to interact with others in a socially appropriate manner. It would basically focus on improving the overall quality of life of the patient and the caregivers. This could be done with the help of clinical psychologists and neuropsychologists who would perform assessments and depending on the results of the tests would make recommendations for rehabilitation programmes. Neuropsychological assessment is necessary prior to implementation of cognitive remediation, in order to provide a person's areas of relative strength and weakness. The psychologists on the other hand would provide psychotherapy services to people with traumatic brain injury and their families [10].\n\nIn Document 5-NeuroRehabilitation-A-Multidisciplinary-Approach.pdf in page 233:\n\nThere is general inefficiency that the patient experiences in abstract ideas and relationships.\n\nLast Phase: During the Last phase of Traumatic Brain Injury:\n\nNeuro-Rehabilitation : A multi disciplinary approach\n\nThe patients have fair to good concrete reasoning in controlled setting and disorganized thinking in stressful or uncontrolled setting.\n\n\u2022 Patient's abstract thinking is deficient.\n\n6. Problem Solving and Judgement:\n\nThis takes place when a goal cannot be achieved directly. Ideally goals involve identification, consideration of relevant information, exploration of possible solutions and selection of the best solution. Judgement is based on the way a person decides over other options.\n\nEarly Phase: During the Early phase of Traumatic Brain Injury:\n\n\u2022 No evidence of substantial improvement in the early phase has been seen.\n\nMiddle Phase: During the Middle phase of Traumatic Brain Injury:\n\nIn Document 5-NeuroRehabilitation-A-Multidisciplinary-Approach.pdf in page 219:\n\nNeuro-Rehabilitation : A multi disciplinary approach\n\nOften, major adjustments are best made in small steps. Simple changes may help the person with brain injury, family and friends to find more enjoyment in their relationships and activities.B y taking each stressful situation one step at a time, the person with brain injury and family may feel that life is becoming a little more \"normal\" again.\n\nSelf-esteem\n\nSelf-esteem is a person's assessment of self-worth that is often adversely affected by brain injury. The greater the self awareness the person with brain injury has, the more likely are negative changes in self-esteem. To counter the negative self worth felt by the client, the therapist needs to:\n\nconstantly make the client express their feelings and focus on the positives.\n\nredirect conversation to positive or neutral thoughts.\n\nExpress their concern and desire to understand the person's feelings.\n\nNew user question: Case study\n\nPatient Name: X\nGender: Male\nAge: 45\nDate of Birth: 05/12/1978\nDiagnosis: Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) due to a motor vehicle accident\n\nBackground:\nOn January 15, 2023, X was involved in a severe motor vehicle accident, resulting in a traumatic brain injury.

He is undergoing cognitive rehabilitation therapy to address these issues.\n\n2. Motor function: John has right-sided weakness (hemiparesis) as a result of his brain injury. He is currently able to walk with the assistance of a walker and is participating in physical therapy to improve his strength, balance, and coordination.\n\n3.
