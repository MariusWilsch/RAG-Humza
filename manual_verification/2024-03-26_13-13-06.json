  "llm_response": "The CAPITALIZATION RATE DERIVATION formulas are as follows:\n\n1. Capitalization Rate (CR):\n\\[ CR = \\frac{NOI}{V (or SP)} = \\frac{EGI - Opex}{V (or SP)} \\]\n\n2. Over-all Rate (CR):\n\\[ CR = Recapture rate + Return of Capital (or Interest rate) \\]\n\nThese formulas are used in real estate appraisal to calculate the capitalization rate, which is an important metric in determining the value of a property based on its income potential."
