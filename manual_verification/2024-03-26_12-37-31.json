  "llm_response": "The term for a situation where a child of a person receives nothing from the will is \"pretermitted heir.\" This refers to a child who is not mentioned or provided for in a will but would have been entitled to inherit under the laws of distribution and descent. It typically arises when a parent inadvertently forgets to include the child in the will or mistakenly believes the child is deceased."
