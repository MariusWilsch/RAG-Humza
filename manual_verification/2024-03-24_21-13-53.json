  "llm_response": "To calculate the Gross Rent Multiplier (GRM), you need to divide the sales price of a property by its gross annual rental income. The formula for GRM is:\n\n$$ GRM = \\frac{Sales Price}{Gross Annual Rental Income} $$\n\nTo establish an accurate GRM, it's recommended to have data from at least three comparable properties that have recently sold and were rented at the time of sale. This helps in determining a suitable GRM for the subject property."
