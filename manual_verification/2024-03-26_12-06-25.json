  "llm_response": "In the context of probate, the possible outcomes include the distribution of assets according to the terms of the will, payment of debts and taxes from the estate, and the final closure of the estate by the probate court. For example, if someone passes away and leaves a will, the probate process will involve validating the will, identifying and appraising assets, paying off debts, and distributing the remaining assets to the beneficiaries as outlined in the will."
