List the income information in statement form, then compute the estimated potential gross income.\n\nApartment rental income is $96,000. Outlay for janitorial service is\n\n$14,700, with another $1,700 for supplies. Utilities are $10,600, and main- tenance and repairs amount to about $3,000. Taxes are $5,700. Income from washers and dryers is $1,900. Building depreciation is estimated at $4,500 per year. Rental spaces in the adjacent parking lot bring in $5,400 per year.\n\nIn Document 7_WeakPDF_2008 Fundamentals Of Real Estate Appraisal 10th Ed.pdf in page 275:\n\nExercise 15.3\n\nThe income capitalization and cost approaches will be most important valuing the subject property. The cost approach will set the upper limit of value, as there is land available for similar construction. The income capitalization approach is important because of the property\u2019s income-producing abilities and potential. The value reached by the income capitalization approach will be influenced by the existence of major tenants, who may be financially sound but who also may benefit from long-term contracts which may not reflect the recent dramatic increases in property values in the area.\n\nIn Document 2_Appraisal Methods.pdf in page 16:\n\nThis section provides an overview of the steps used to develop and apply the income approach to value . It will examine various methods of capitalization and the selection of rates .\n\nSteps in the Income Approach to Value\n\nThe steps used to value property by the income approach are:\n\nEstimate potential gross income .\n\nDeduct vacancy and collection loss .\n\nAdd miscellaneous income to arrive at effective gross income (EGI) .\n\nEstimate expenses before discount, recapture, and taxes .\n\nDeduct expenses from EGI to determine the net operating income (NOI) .\n\nSelect the proper capitalization rate .\n\nDetermine the appropriate capitalization procedure to be used .\n\nCapitalize the net income into an indication of present value .\n\nNew user question: How do I carry out the income approach for a condo?\n\n\n\n",
  "llm_response": "To carry out the income approach for a condo, you would follow these steps:\n\n1. Estimate the potential gross income (PGI) by considering the rental income the condo unit could generate.\n2. Deduct vacancy and collection losses from the PGI to calculate the effective gross income (EGI).\n3. Add any miscellaneous income, such as parking fees or storage rentals, to the EGI.\n4. Estimate the expenses related to the condo unit, including maintenance, utilities, property taxes, insurance, and any other operating costs.\n5. Subtract the total expenses from the EGI to determine the net operating income (NOI).\n6. Select an appropriate capitalization rate based on market data, property risk, and other factors.\n7. Apply the capitalization rate to the NOI to determine the value of the condo unit using the income approach.\n\nIf you have specific income and expense data for the condo unit, you can plug those figures into the formula to calculate its value based on its income-generating potential."
