  "llm_response": "An \"action in rem\" is a legal action that deals with rights in property and is typically brought against the property itself rather than against a specific person. This type of action seeks to establish or determine title to property, as opposed to actions that are brought against a person (in personam). For example, a foreclosure proceeding is often considered an action in rem because it is directed at the property itself to satisfy a debt, rather than solely against the debtor."
