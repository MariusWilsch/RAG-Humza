If apartment and room sizes are standard, thi work will be greatly simplified. If there are units of many differe sizes, however, each apartment must be recorded. In such a case, floor-by-floor room breakdown would not be as useful as an apai ment-by-apartment breakdown. Because most multiunit apartments are standardized, a typical floor plan that indicates the size, place ment, and layout of the apartments would be the easiest and best wa to show them.\n\nThere are some physical features that an appraiser may not b able to learn about a house or apartment building without breaking into walls, but if a checklist of items to be inspected, such as those Figure 8.4, is prepared in advance, most of the building\u2019s deficiencie; as well as its special features can be identified.

The homebuyer who intends to occupy the home generally is less concerned than is the investor with the property\u2019s investment value based on its poten- tial cash flow. For most homebuyers, the most important consideration the price that other similar properties have sold for recently.\n\nis\n\nMost appraisals are based on fee simple ownership of the real estate being appraised, but some properties do not include all of the rights of ownership.

Those prices may indicate the change in overall market con- ditions in that period. Of course, the appraiser must check the other factors involved in the sales to make sure that they do not involve related parties or that the presence of some other factor has not made a sale less than an arm\u2019s-length transaction. For instance, a quick resale may be necessitated by an unexpected job transfer and could have the effect of lowering the sales price. A sudden illness of the buyer and subsequent transfer of the property could also indicate a sale that does not accurately reflect market conditions. The property also could have been a \u201cfixer-upper\u201d with a considerably higher resale price, indicative of the extent of its rehabilitation rather than the state of the market.\n\nmay be property differences that require adjustment because they have effect on the typical buyer\u2019s decision to pur-\n\nNew user question: What is the main difference of appeasing a family house vs appraising a single person apartment\n\n",
  "llm_response": "When appraising a single-family house versus a multiunit residential building like an apartment, the main difference lies in the level of detail and complexity involved in evaluating the property. While the basic principles of appraising real estate apply to both types of properties, a multiunit building typically requires more information to be assessed, possibly in various categories such as individual apartment units, common areas, amenities, and rental income potential.\n\nFor a single-family house, the focus is primarily on the specific features and characteristics of the individual property itself, along with comparable sales in the area. On the other hand, when appraising a multiunit building, the appraiser may need to consider factors such as the size, layout, and condition of each apartment unit, rental income analysis, common areas, and overall market trends for multifamily properties.\n\nIn summary, the main difference in appraising a single-family house versus a multiunit residential building lies in the complexity of evaluating multiple units, rental income potential, and overall market considerations associated with multifamily properties."
