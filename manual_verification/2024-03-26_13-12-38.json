The investor will expect the property to provide both a return on the investment (profit on the amount invested) and a return of the invest- ment (the amount invested). The rate of return the investor in real estate receives is the capitalization rate (also called the overall capi- talization rate), which can be expressed as a relationship between the annual net operating income a property produces and its value. In equation form, it can be expressed as follows:\n\nUsing yield capitalization, the appraiser estimates that the property may be expected to produce in the future and th estimates the present worth of the right to receive that income:\n\nNet operating income = Capitalization rate or L.

  "llm_response": "The capitalization rate can be derived through various methods, one of which involves comparing net income figures and sales prices of comparable properties. Another approach is to break down the rate into its component parts, such as the recapture rate (return of investment) and interest rate (return on investment), which are estimated separately. The recapture rate is often determined using the straight-line method, while the interest rate is typically developed using the market extraction method.\n\nFurthermore, the band of investment method considers both the rate required by the lender (mortgage constant) and the rate needed for the equity investor's desired pretax cash flow (equity capitalization rate) when deriving the capitalization rate. It's important to note that a high-risk investment usually results in a higher capitalization rate and a lower property value, whereas a low-risk investment tends to have a lower capitalization rate and a higher property value.\n\nIn equation form, the capitalization rate can be expressed as the relationship between the annual net operating income a property generates and its value:\n\n$Net operating income = Capitalization rate or Value$\n\nThis formula illustrates the fundamental concept behind the capitalization rate and its derivation in real estate appraisal."
