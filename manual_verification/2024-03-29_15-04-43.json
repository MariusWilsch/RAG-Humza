  "llm_response": "A reasonable person is a legal concept that refers to a hypothetical individual who possesses qualities of attention, knowledge, intelligence, and judgment that society expects from its members to protect their own interests and the interests of others. In legal terms, the behavior of a reasonable person is used as a standard to determine negligence. For example, if a driver fails to stop at a red light, a reasonable person would have stopped, and therefore, the driver may be considered negligent."
