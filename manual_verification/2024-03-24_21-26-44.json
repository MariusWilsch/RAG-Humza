  "llm_response": "Discounted cash flow (DCF) is calculated by discounting the projected cash flows of an investment project back to their present value using a discount rate. The formula for calculating the net present value (NPV) of cash flows is:\n\n$$ NPV = \\sum_{t=0}^{n} \\frac{C_t}{(1+i)^t} $$\n\nWhere:\n- \\( NPV \\) = Net Present Value\n- \\( C_t \\) = Cash flow at time \\( t \\)\n- \\( i \\) = Discount rate\n- \\( n \\) = Total number of time periods\n\nBy discounting each cash flow back to its present value and summing them up, you can determine the value of the investment project in today's terms."
