This period of change dawned with an almost exclusively experience-based neurorehabilitation approach, inaugurated by a number of schools and usually prac- ticed in separation from other medical disciplines. Over time, in most subspecialities, evidence-based neurorehabilitation has been gradually established. This move towards a more scientific and integrated paradigm is illustrated by smoother transitions from acute care: for instance, stroke patients into early rehabilita- tion requiring close multidisciplinary interactions characterized by close cooperation between clinical staff and researchers. This early phase of rehabilitation is followed by longer-term functional training approaches and social integration programmes, which are today being successfully applied for patients with stroke, brain injury, and spinal cord injury (SCI). Such modern rehabilitation approaches have strong theoretical underpinnings, for instance on evidence gained from animal experiments investigating the exploitation potential of neuroplasticity or from well-conducted patient studies concerning the effect of longer training times on the recovery of sensorimotor function during rehabilitation in patient with various forms of central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system damage. However, despite all this recent pro- gress, we must acknowledge the evident limitations of our treat- ment approaches. After severe CNS damage neurological deficits\n\nIn Document neurorehabilitation-healing-and-hope-for-brain-injury-survivors.pdf in page 1:\n\nDespite the many successes in neurorehabilitation, challenges persist. Access to specialized care, especially in remote areas, can be limited. Additionally, the high cost of technology and rehabilitation services can create disparities in access to care. Addressing these challenges is crucial to ensuring that all individuals with neurological injuries receive the support they need. The future of neurorehabilitation holds promise. Advances in neuroimaging, genetics, and personalized medicine are paving the way for more targeted and effective increased collaboration among treatments. Moreover, researchers, clinicians, and technology developers is likely to result in more innovative and accessible rehabilitation options [5].\n\nIn Document download.pdf in page 5:\n\nVol. 10 No. 2, 2006\n\nThe Changing Face of Neurological Rehabilitation\n\nrehabilitation is that experience, learning and active use of the affected limbs appear to modulate the adaptive reorganization that inevitably occurs after cortical injury. From current research, it seems likely that, for rehabilitation to be effective in optimizing neural reorganization and functional recovery, increased emphasis needs to be placed on challenging, engaging and meaningful task training to promote learning (for example54,59,60). In addition, research findings indicate significant gains and enhanced structural plasticity when therapy is commenced early suggesting that delaying commencement of rehabilitation may reduce the efficacy of treatment61.\n\nIn Document neurorehab.pdf in page 67:\n\nSECTION 1 general aspects of neurorehabilitation\n\nencouraged to wheel the wheelchair, walk the treadmill with body support, or to walk short distances, climb stairs, or ride a station- ary bike adapted to their physical capabilities. This type of train- ing may also have a positive influence on depression [47].\n\nNovel, translational therapies Although not specific for ageing patients until now, science has provided new ideas on how to maximize \u2018traditional/conven- tional\u2019 therapy interventions. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), as well as paired associative stimulation (PAS), are being used to increase recovery of upper extremity function. The results are positive and will be included in future intervention strategies for all stroke patients. \u2018Noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation combined with motor training did enhance the acquisition of a novel skill with the paretic hand\u2019 [48]. Although the mean age of the partici- pants in this study was 58, the positive effects were there for the >70-year-old person [49].\n\nNew user question: What are the newest finding in neurorehabilitation\n\n",
  "llm_response": "In the field of neurorehabilitation, some of the newest findings include the use of novel translational therapies such as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (TDCS), and paired associative stimulation (PAS) to enhance recovery of upper extremity function. These therapies have shown positive results and are being integrated into future intervention strategies for stroke patients. Additionally, research has shown that noninvasive transcranial brain stimulation combined with motor training can improve the acquisition of novel skills, even in older individuals above the age of 70. These innovative approaches aim to maximize the effectiveness of traditional therapy interventions and promote better outcomes in neurorehabilitation."
