  "llm_response": "When you are involved in a hit and run incident, which is a crime where the driver leaves the scene of an accident without identifying themselves, there are legal consequences. Hit and run is a serious offense that can result in criminal charges, fines, and even imprisonment, depending on the circumstances and the laws of the jurisdiction where the incident occurred. It is important to report the accident and cooperate with authorities to avoid further legal repercussions. An example of a hit and run case could be when a driver hits another vehicle in a parking lot and drives away without providing any contact information."
