  "llm_response": "The Mortgage Constant, denoted as $MC$, is a key financial indicator used in real estate appraisal. It represents the ratio of the Annual Debt Service (ADS) to the Mortgage amount (M), which is also equivalent to the interest rate (i) divided by the term in the formula $[1-(1+i)^{-n}]$, where 'n' represents the number of periods. The Mortgage Constant is a crucial factor in determining the cash flow structure and financial viability of a mortgage loan. It helps in assessing the level of debt coverage and the overall financial risk associated with a real estate investment."
