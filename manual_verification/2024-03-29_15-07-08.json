  "llm_response": "In legal terms, a witness incriminates themselves when their testimony implicates themselves in a crime or wrongdoing. This can happen when a witness provides information that suggests their own involvement in illegal activities. For example, if a witness admits to being present at the scene of a crime, their testimony may incriminate themselves. It's important to note that witnesses have the right against self-incrimination, which means they cannot be compelled to provide testimony that would expose them to criminal prosecution."
