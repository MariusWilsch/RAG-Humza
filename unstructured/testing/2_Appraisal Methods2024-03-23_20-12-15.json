This approach assumes the typical buyer will compare sales and asking prices to make the best possible purchase . Like the cost approach, the sales comparison approach is based on the principle of substitution . This principle presumes that a prudent buyer will pay no more for a property than the purchase price of a similar and equally desirable property .",

Vacancy and collection loss should be allowed on all properties because even the most stable property will experience some loss of income over time .\n\nVacancy is the loss in potential income attributed to unoccupied periods . This occurs during periods of tenant turnover, building renovation and refurbishment, and sluggish economic conditions . It is expressed as a percentage of potential gross income . Vacancy rates will vary depending on the age, condition, and quality of the building as well as the location of the property . Vacancy allowance for older motels/hotels may be as high as 50\u201360 percent, while for newer, well-located, and well-managed office structures, it may be as low as 1 to 3 percent . As buildings age, vacancy rates generally increase because of physical deterioration and functional and external obsolescence .",

Proper rate selection is necessary to correctly estimate value . Small variations in the capitalization rate will result in substantial differences in value estimates . For example:\n\n$39,035 (NOI) \u00f7 0 .10 (capitalization rate) = $390,350\n\n$39,035 (NOI) \u00f7 0 .11 (capitalization rate) = $354,864",

The yield capitalization method is not discussed in this manual . In the direct capitalization method, both the land and building residual techniques are demonstrated .\n\nDirect Capitalization Method\n\nIn this method, net income is capitalized into an indication of market value using an overall rate developed from the market with no prediction being made for the behavior of income or for the period of recapture . An overall rate is the annual NOI divided by the sale price . Capitalization of the income stream is accomplished by dividing the estimated income by the appropriate rate . You can also calculate it by multiplying the income by an income factor .\n\nIn the following example of direct capitalization using an overall rate, the income- expense ratios, remaining economic lives, and land-to-building ratios of the sale are comparable to those of the subject property . The sale property is located in the same taxing district as the subject and has the same effective tax rate. Note: If it were not located in the same taxing district, adjustments can be made so the comparison is valid .",

This approach is based on the principle of anticipation\u2014that market value is equal to the present worth of anticipated future benefits of ownership . Income-producing property is purchased for the right to receive the future income stream of that property . You must evaluate this income stream in terms of quantity, quality, and duration, then convert it by means of an appropriate capitalization rate into an estimate of market value . Take care that the rent, expenses, and rates reflect those expected by the typical investor for the type of property being valued .",
