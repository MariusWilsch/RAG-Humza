These are:\n\ne Cost approach;\n\ne Sales comparison (market) approach; and\n\ne Income approach.\n\nAll three approaches are used to arrive at an indication of value. The three indications of\n\nvalue are then reconciled into one final conclusion of market value.\n\nThe fundamentals of these approaches are simple, but the application is often complex. The appraiser must:\n\ne Understand the basics involved in each approach;\n\no Have the ability to recognize pertinent data; and\n\ne The skill to select the proper method and apply it to the specific problem involved.\n\nCounty valuation systems use a combination of the cost and sales comparison approaches to arrive at RMV. This combined process is called the market-related cost approach and is primarily used when valuing residential property.",

The income approach, also called income capitalization, converts future benefits of property ownership into an indication of present worth (market value).

    "text": "Gross Income Multipliers\n\nA gross income multiplier (GIM) is a factor calculated by dividing the sale price of a property by its gross income. Gross income is normally defined as the annual income prior to any deduction for services or expenses. Using a GIM assumes that any differences between the subject and comparables are reflected in the rents of each property. If the sales used to extract a GIM from the market are valid and the properties are comparable, the resulting factor should produce a reliable indicator of value for the subject. Using a GIM to arrive at an estimate of value is one form of direct capitalization.",

A factor is the reciprocal of a rate, or F = | + R. Using this basic formula, the GIM can be derived thus: Value = Income + Rate,orV =1+ R\n\nAfter extracting a GIM from the market, the gross income of the subject for a single period is multiplied by a factor to produce an estimate of value. The multiplying factor is called a gross rent multiplier (GRM) if the period is one month. It\u2019s called a GIM if the period is one year. Generally, monthly rents are used for single-family residences and annual incomes are used for other income-producing properties.",

Properties from which a GIM is developed, and properties to which a GIM is applied, must be similar in effective age, quality of construction, and use. For example, it would not be appropriate to apply a GIM to a 20-unit property that was developed from sales of 4\u2014to 6\u2014unit properties.\n\nWhen developing a GIM, give careful consideration to:\n\nGross income-to-expense ratio\u2014The gross income-to-value relationship may be different for similar properties depending on the expenses involved in producing the income. The gross income for an office building where rent includes heat, lights, water, and janitorial service will be substantially greater than the gross income from an identical building where these services are not furnished. If you develop a GIM from a sale in which these services are furnished and apply it to the income of a building that does not include the same services, you will not get an accurate indication of value.",

This approach is based on the principle of anticipation\u2014that market value is equal to the present worth of anticipated future benefits of ownership. Income-producing property is purchased for the right to receive the future income stream of that property. You must evaluate this income stream in terms of quantity, quality, and duration, then convert it by means of an appropriate capitalization rate into an estimate of market value.
