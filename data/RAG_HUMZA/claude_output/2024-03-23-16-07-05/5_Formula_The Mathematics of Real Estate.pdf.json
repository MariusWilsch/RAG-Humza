    "page_content": "Introduction\n\nReal estate appraisal is more of a practical art than a theoretical science. Appraisers use a\nnumber of time-honored formulas without great attention to the theoretical derivation of the\nformulas. While this \"cookbook\" approach may work as a matter of everyday practice, it leaves\nmuch to be desired from a pedagogical viewpoint. When valuation formulas do have a\nderivation from a certain set of assumptions, then it is quite inappropriate—particularly for the\ntechnically-oriented student—for the formulas to be taught as \"recipes\" established by some\nauthority and simply to be memorized and used.\n\nThere are a number of reasonably complex formulas that are used in the income approach to real\nestate appraisal, particularly as developed in the United States. The necessary assumptions and\nthe proofs of these formulas are usually to be found only in a few scarce journal articles in the\nUnited States or in out-of-print books. Hence we have attempted to give here, all in one place,\nfresh algebraic derivations of the major formulas to make them available to technically adept\nstudents and practitioners.\n\nThe topic of internal rates of return or IRR's is also covered largely because IRR's are often\nmisunderstood and improperly applied in the real estate appraisal profession as well as in other\nareas of business. The point is that appraisers should rely on net present values, not IRR's, when\ngiving advice about the selection of investment projects.\n\nA number of new results are also presented:\n\n(1) a general formula for the valuation of changing income streams defined by linear\nrecurrence relations which has all the usual formulas for valuing changing income streams\nas special cases (e.g., straight line changing annuity, constant ratio changing annuity, and\nEllwood J premise),\n\n(2) an analysis of the straight line and Hoskold capitalization methods which shows that both\nmethods are appropriate for certain declining income streams where the income decline can\nbe motivated as the interest losses resulting from a hypothetical capital recovery sinking\nfund using a substandard rate (below the discount rate), and\n\n(3) a general theorem about amortization tables where the principal reductions can be\narbitrarily specified and an application of the theorem to give an alternative proof of the\nmain result about the Hoskold capitalization method.\n",

    "page_content": "The Cap-Rate Style of Reasoning There are various ways to express the formulas of financial mathematics. The income approach to real estate appraisal, particularly in the USA, has developed a strong tendency to express formulas in a certain way which, in turn, promotes a certain \"style\" of reasoning. In making the following remarks about this \"cap-rate style\" our purpose is not to criticize it but only to point out that it is a free choice and that other choices would also be quite possible. Let us begin with the basic formula to capitalize a perpetual income stream of one dollar payments or incomes: $V = \\frac{1}{i}$  How should the formula be changed to value a truncated income stream stopping at time n? The \"cap-rate style\" is to change the formula by modifying the capitalization rate to account for the truncation of the income stream at † = n to obtain: $a(n, i) = \\frac{1}{i+\\frac{1}{s(n,i)}}$ The new formula is explained using the reasoning about \"return on investment\" and \"return of investment.\" Since the income stream terminates, the underlying asset has wasted away so the capitalization rate must be \"loaded\" with the sinking fund factor SFF(n,i) = 1/s(n,i) to account for the return of investment. There is, however, another perfectly equivalent way to modify the perpetuity formula to account for the truncation of the income stream. Instead of changing the denominator (the capitalization rate), change the numerator (the income). Instead of loading the cap rate, we can make a deduction from the income (1 per year) to turn it into a perpetual income stream which can then be capitalized by the same denominator of i. What is the deduction to perpetualize the income--to replace the truncated stream with a perpetual stream with the same value? From the first income of 1 at time 1, set aside 1/(1+i)\" which is equivalent to another 1 at time n+1 (i.e., which would accumulate to 1 at time n+1 in a sinking fund). From the second income of 1 at t = 2, set aside another 1/(1+i)\" which accumulates to 1 at time n+2, and so forth. By making the 1/(1+i)\" deduction from each of the l's in the truncated income stream, one generates another stream of I's at the times n+1, n+2, .., ntn. The same deductions are made from those I's, and so forth. Thus the perpetual version of the truncated income stream of n l's at times 1, 2,..., n is 1-1/(1+i)n which can then be capitalized by dividing by the interest rate: $a(n, i) = \\frac{1-\\frac{1}{(1+i)^n}}{i}$ This formula is also in the IRV format but it reflects the opposite \"income style\" of reasoning, i.e., modify the income instead of modifying the capitalization rate.

The amount 1/(1ti)\" is the depreciation charge against each \"1\" so that it can be replaced n years later to perpetuate the income stream.\nWe will see again and again that formulas are developed in real estate mathematics so that the changes are made to the cap rates, not the incomes. That in turn determines the style of reasoning and explanation, e.g., loading cap rates to recover capital instead of charging depreciation against income to replace capital. It is not a question of right or wrong. Both the formulas for a(ni) are correct and equivalent.\nSome formulas might be more elegantly\nexpressed by modifying cap rates, while other formulas will find simpler forms by changing the income terms. The mathematics of real estate valuation has chosen the cap-rate road, not the income road. With the increasing use of electronic computers to value uneven cash flows, the form of the formulas will become less important but the cap-rate style of reasoning will probably have a longer lasting influence.\nAdjusting Capitalization Rates for Appreciation and Depreciation\nWe are considering a series of payments or income I that terminates at t = n. There is no further\nvalue after that time so this corresponds in real estate valuation to an asset or property that wastes completely away at t= n. Clearly there are other possibilities so we should see how the formulas in the capitalization rate format could be adjusted.\nFor instance, if the asset had the same value V at time n as at time 0, then it would be equivalent\nto the perpetuity of incomes I and the value would be V = I/i.

Hence the value equation is:\n\nV = a(H, Y)[NOI - MVRm] + (1 + Y)^-H[V - MV] + MV.\n\nBy comparing this value equation with the previous one, we see that the only difference is that i is replaced by Rm so the direct capitalization rate will be:\n\nR = MRm + (1 - M)Y.\n\nEllwood and Akerson Formulas with Constant Income\n\nWe now consider a more general case where the mortgage is amortized over a period longer than the holding period. With monthly payments, the mortgage constant Rm is 12 times the monthly payment and the balance due on the mortgage at the end of the holding period is MVbal(12H). We further assume that the asset appreciates by the proportion Ao over the holding period so the resale value is (1+Ao)V. These assumptions yield the value equation:\n\nV = a(H, Y)[NOI - RmMV] + (1 + Y)^-H[(1 + Ao) V - MVbal(12H)] + MV.\n\nCollecting the V terms to the left yields:\n\nV[1 + a(H, Y)RmM - (1 + Ao)/(1 + Y)^H + Mbal(12H)/(1 + Y)^H - M] = a(H, Y)NOI.\n\nDividing through and rearranging terms gives:\n\nV = [NOI]/[a(H, Y) + RmM - (1 + Ao)/(a(H, Y)(1 + Y)^H) + Mbal(12H)/(a(H, Y)(1 + Y)^H) - M/(a(H, Y))].",

We will consider changing income streams where the Ik's are defined in a regular manner by some relationship, and then we will seek a concise formula for the above defined value V (that is not just the defining summation of the present values). These concise formulas are of more theoretical than practical importance in the sense that an appraiser equipped with an electronic spreadsheet can now directly use the definition to arrive at a numerical value for the present value of a projected numerical income stream.\nWe will present a formula for the valuation of changing income streams defined by linear recurrence relations (linear difference equations) which seems to be new and to have all the usual formulas for valuing regular income streams as special cases (e.g., straight line changing annuity, exponential or constant ratio changing annuity, and streams changing according to the Ellwood J premise).\nAs a special application, we show that the straight line and Hoskold methods of capitalizing income streams can be seen as the discounted present value of declining streams where the decline in income can be conceptualized as interest losses. These losses result, as it were, from a make-believe reinvestment of a capital recovery portion of the income in a hypothetical sinking fund with an interest rate below the discount rate 0 in the straight line case and some \"safe\" rate is in the Hoskold case). The declining income stream of the straight line case can be evaluated using a known formula for the straight line changing annuity. The more general formula given here is needed for the declining income stream of the Hoskold case.\nValuing Income Streams Defined by Linear\nRecurrence Relations\nConsider the general linear recurrence relation defined by\nyo=c and y = myk-1 + b for some constants m, b, and c.\nThe general solution has the form\nYn =m^n c + m^{n-1} b + \\ldots + mb + b",

Since not all appraisers are fluent in that language, it might be useful to restate some of the results using amortization tables. We begin with a general result about amortization tables where the principal reductions P1, P2, .., Pn are arbitrarily given along with the interest or discount rate i. The value V is the sum of the principal reductions. The incomes (or payments) per period are determined from this data. The Main Theorem is that the discounted present value of the incomes determined in this manner from the given Pk's is the value V which is the sum of the Pk's. For the results about the Ring and Hoskold methods, we consider amortization tables where the principal reductions or capital recovery entries are generated by a sinking fund at a rate r not necessarily the same as the\ndiscount rate i. When r = 0, we will have an amortization table for the straight line or Ring\nmethod which shows the declining income for that case. When r = is between 0 and i, we have a\nHoskold amortization table that shows the declining income for that case. When r = i, we have\nusual amortization table with level income or amortization payments. If r > i, we have an amortization table with involves capital recovery at a supra-standard rate r and which thus generates a rising income stream.\nThe principal or capital to be recovered is defined as the sum of those given principal reductions.\nCertain relationships hold between the columns in an amortization table. The interest in each year is the rate i times the balance or unrecovered capital from the previous year. The entry in the payment or income column is the sum of the interest and principal reduction (or capital recovery) columns. The entry in the balance (or unrecovered capital) column is the previous entry in the column minus the principal reduction (or capital recovery). The last entry in the balance or unrecovered capital column is zero.\nLet P1, P2, .., Pn be the given principal reductions, let V = P1+P2+...-Pn be the sum, and let i be\nthe discount rate.\nThat is the only data given for the following general theorem about\namortization",

It is the net present project. There is n pre eat comes is that disco une rate progrich herinee vale\nof real estate for retail purposes: location, location, and location. In a similar manner, we can say there are three investment measuring devices: NPV, NPV, and NPV. The internal rate of return or IRR is not one of them.\nWhy analyze IRR at all? The IRR is important because it is widely used by practitioners and textbook writers. However, many of those who recommend the IRR concept seem to be unaware or only vaguely aware of the many problems with IRR's. Hence it is necessary to reiterate the many fallacies in the use of IRR's and to show the limited domain where IRR's can be correctly applied.\nDefinition of IRR\nAn investment project is defined by a series of cash flows Co, C1, C2, .., Cn ... where C is the cashflow at the end of time t (time periods are taken as years). A negative cashflow G is an investment into the project and a positive cashflow C is a payout from the project. Given the discount rate i (the opportunity cost of capital to be invested in projects of similar riskiness), the net present value NPV of a project Co, C1, C2, ..., Cn is:\nNPV = C_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{C_k}{(1+i)^k}\nwhere we might write NPV(i) to make explicit the use of i as the discount rate in the definition of NPV. An internal rate of return IRR of the project can be defined as a rate which sets the net present value to zero:\nNPV(IRR) = C_0 + \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{C_k}{(1+IRR)^k} = 0\nWhile we may speak of \"the\" IRR of a project, there are some projects which have multiple IRR's.\nIf we graph NPV on the vertical axis and the discount rate i on the horizontal axis, then the IRR is the discount rate at which the NPV curve cuts the horizontal axis.",

Except in a few simple cases, IRR's (as the roots of a polynomial) are best computed through an iterative procedure of ever closer approximation.\nFortunately, such numerical computational procedures are now built into most hand-held financial calculators so finding IRR's is no longer a practical problem.\nTo construct an example with an IRR = .20 or 20%, choose any initial investment of say $1000\n(so that Co = -1000), and then take the cashflows as the interest $200 until the final time period\nwhen the principal is return as well.\nProject,C0,C1,C2,C3,IRR,NPV @ 10%,NPV @ 12%\nA,-1000,200,200,1200,20%,$248.69,$192.15\nB,-1000,500,500,300,23.38%,$243.43,$200.92\nC,-1000,120,120,1120,12%,$49.74,$0\n\nPitfall 1 in Using IRR's: The Negative of a Project has the same IRR\nOne of the simplest \"rules\" you will find in the literature is that an investment project is profitable (that is, has positive NPV) if its IRR is greater than the interest rate i.

Thus we have the rule:\nIf the NPV of a project declines as the discount rate i increases then i < IRR implies 0 < NPV.\nPitfall 2 in Using IRR's: \"Choose the Project with the Highest IRR\"\nWhen considering the choice of projects one must be explicit about the interrelationships between the projects. Is it a situation where one can choose several projects out of a set of projects (i.e., choose all projects with positive NPV) or is one restricted to choosing only one project out of the set (i.e., choose the project with highest NPV). The alleged rule \"Choose the project with the highest IRR\" is usually applied in the situation where one can only choose one project out of the set of alternatives (e.g., build only one building on a site).\nIt is easy to see the fallacy if the projects are of quite different scale. Suppose one project turns $100 into $200 in one year for an IRR of 100% while another project turns $1000 into $1500 in a year for an IRR of only 50%. If one must choose one project or the other and cannot repeat the first project ten times), then clearly the second project is more profitable (assuming a discount rate less than 50%) even though it has the lower IRR.\nTo be taken seriously, the \"Highest IRR\" rule should be amended to read: \"Among projects with the same required investment capital, choose the project with the highest IRR.\" This amended rule is also wrong as can be seen by comparing projects A and B in the previous table. Both have the same invested capital of $1000 and project B has the higher IRR (23.38% versus 20%).\nBut at the discount rate of 10% (or lower rates), project A has the higher NPV so it is the best project at certain discount rates.\nPerhaps the \"Highest IRR\" rule seems attractive because many practitioners incorrectly extrapolate the rule from the case of one-year projects (only one cash payout) to multi-year projects. The Highest IRR rule works for projects with the same initial capital investment and only one cash payout at the end of the period. Then it is, of course, true that the project with the highest cash payout is the best project (although both projects might have negative NPV at high discount rates).\nIf there is a multi-year payout, then projects begin to differ in more subtle ways. Some projects pay out early while others pay out later but in greater amounts. To know which is best, one must know how heavily to discount the future payouts--which means one must use the discount rate to compute the NPV. Thus it is easy to see that the multi-year highest IRR rule could not possibly be valid since it makes no mention of the discount rate.\nOne can only ignore the discount rate when all the cash payouts from one project exceed the payouts at the same times from the other equal-investment project (which is why one could use the highest IRR rule for one-period",

    "page_content": "Pitfall 3 in Using IRR's: Multiple IRR's\n\nIt is unfortunately possible for a project to have two or more IRR's. However, this can only happen if the cashflows changes signs more than once (e.g., go from negative to positive and then back to negative). Then the NPV curve could cross the horizontal axis twice giving two IRR's.\n\nProject,C0,C1,C2,C4,IRR1,IRR2,NPV @ 30%\nD,-1000,1450,1500,2200,28.52%,39.34%,$1.59\n\nProject D starts out with an investment of $1000, has two positive cash payouts, and then has a large negative closing cost of $2200 (e.g., cleaning up the environment after a project is finished).\n\nThe project has two IRR's at about 28.52% and 39.34%. In between, the project has a small positive NPV.\n\nIt might be noted that a project might have no IRR instead of multiple IRR's. For instance, if we lower the payout C2 in project D from 1500 to 1450, then the NPV curve shifts down enough that it does not cross the horizontal axis at all so it has no IRR.\n\nCriterion for Pair-wise Choice Between Projects\n\nWe have placed most of the emphasis on the fallacies and pitfalls in using IRRs. When can IRR's be used to make choices between investment projects? Under certain assumptions, the IRR concept can be used to make a choice between two mutually exclusive projects. We will assume that for both projects, the NPV's decline as the discount rate increases.",

Why not B-A? The answer is that the difference project should also satisfy our rule that the NPV declines as the discount rate increases. A-B satisfies the rule while B-A does not. This can be seen from the pattern of the signs in the cashflows. If the cashflows go from negative to positive as time increases, and do not reverse later on, then the NPV curve will slope downward. Since the difference project A-B has that property, we say the \"A is later than B\" in the sense that A's payouts are unambiguously later than the payouts from B.\nNPV\n23.38%\nA-B\n10.73% 20%\nSince A is later than B, it can be intuitively understood why A is better before--and B after, the cutoff point of 10.73%. As the discount rate increases above 10.73%, both projects lose NPV but A loses NPV faster since its payouts are later and will thus be hit harder by the higher discount rate. The reverse happens as the discount rate decreases below the cutoff point.\nIt is also possible to understand the pair-wise choice rule in terms of our previous result that a project (with downward sloping NPV) is profitable if its IRR exceeds the discount rate. The difference project A-B can be thought of as the project of converting from B to A. If the discount rate is below the cutoff point of 10.73%, which is the IRR of the difference project (with downward sloping NPV), then it is profitable to convert from B to A, i.e., A is better than\nB. If the discount rate exceeds the cutoff point, then it is unprofitable to convert from B to A, i.e., B is better than A.",

The value of that box of 1's at t = 1 is a4 = a(4,i) and the value of the four 1's in the column at t = 1 is, of course, 4. Thus the value of those 1's minus the box is 4-a4 at t = 1.
