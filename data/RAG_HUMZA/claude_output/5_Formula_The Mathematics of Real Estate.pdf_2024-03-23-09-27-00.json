The periods could be years, months, or any other fixed time period. Unless otherwise stated, the formulas will always assume that the interest rate (% per period) and the units of time are stated using the same period of time. The discount rate may be taken as including the risk-free interest rate and a consideration for risk and illiquidity. But it does not include any \"capital recovery requirements\" to be considered later.\n\nThe first basic formula\n\n$FV = PV(1+i)^n$\n\nstates that given the present value of PV, that is equivalent on the market to the future value after n periods of FV = PV(1+i)^n. If PV = 1, then we have the amount of one at compound interest given in the tables. The present value is said to be \"compounded\" into the future value.\n\n$FV = (1+i)^n$\n\nPV = 1\n\n0 1 2 ... n\n\nThe Present Value Reversion of One\n\nFor each basic function of one, the inverse or reciprocal is also a function of one. The inverse of the amount of one at compound interest is the present value reversion of one.\n\n$PV = \\frac{FV}{(1+i)^n}$\n\n",

We consider a series of equal payment of one. Each payment is discounted back to a present value using the present-value-of-one formula (taking care to use the right time period). Since the results are all amounts of money at the same time, they can be meaningfully added together to get the total present value of the series of equal payments. It is called the present value of an ordinary annuity of one and will be denoted a(n,i).\n\n$a(n,i) = \\frac{1}{(1+i)^1} + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^2} + ... + \\frac{1}{(1+i)^n} = \\sum_{k=1}^n \\frac{1}{(1+i)^k} = \\frac{1 - \\frac{1}{(1+i)^n}}{i}$\n\nGiven a series of equal payments PMT at t = 1, 2,...,n, their present value is PMT a(n,i).

Cover up PV, and you see the PV = PMT/i. Cover up PMT, and you see that the perpetual payment with the present value PV is PMT = iPV.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of this type of formula, many practitioners would like to put the more complicated formulas encountered before into the same format. That is usually possible, and the results are called \"direct capitalization formulas.\"\n\nConsider, for example, the finite series of payments PMT at t = 1,2,...,n with the present value PV = PMTa(n,i).

It is then called a \"capitalization rate\" to distinguish it from the discount rate i.\n\nIn the real estate valuation literature, the amount PMT is the income I (e.g., the net operating income NOI of an income-producing property), the capitalization rate is denoted as R, and the present value is just called the value V. Thus we have the famous I=RV formula.\n\nWe previously saw that the capitalization rate R = 1/a(n,i) could be expressed as the sum of the sinking fund factor and the discount rate so we have:\n\nV = $\\frac{I}{\\frac{1}{a(n,i)}} = \\frac{I}{i+\\frac{1}{s(n,i)}}$.\n\nCross-multiplying shows that each income I is the sum of the amount V/s(n,i) and iV. The latter is simply the interest on the value V and it is called the \"return ON investment.\" Since the amount V/s(n,i) is the sinking fund deposit which would accumulate to V at time n, it is called the \"capital recovery\" part of the income or the \"return OF investment.\"\n\nI = iV + V/s(n,i) = Return on investment + Return of investment.",
