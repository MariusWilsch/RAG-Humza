    "page_content": "Amortization Tables\n\nLet us now consider a loan with the principal of PV which is to be paid off with equal payments PMT = PV/a(n,i) at times 1,2,...,n. Each payment PMT will pay some interest and pay some principal. The interest payments just service the loan; they do not reduce the principal balance. Only the remaining part of PMT can be considered as a principal payment or principal reduction. How much of each payment is considered as interest payment and how much as principal payment? The conventional way to compute interest and principal portions of loan payments is to assume that all the interest due at any time is taken out of the payment, and the remainder of the payment is principal reduction.\n\nLet Bal(k) be the principal balance due on the loan after the payment is made at the end of the kth period. The loan begins with Bal(0) = PV. At the end of the first period, the interest due is iPV = iBal(0). Subtracting from the payment PMT gives the principal portion of the payment PMT-iBal(0). The new balance is the old balance reduced by the principal payment: Bal(1) = Bal(0) - (PMT - iBal(0)). In general, the interest due at the end of the kth period is iBal(k-1) so the principal reduction by the kth payment is:\n\nPR(k) = PMT - iBal(k-1) = (1+i)PR(k-1).\n\nThe new balance at the end of the kth period is:\n\nBal(k) = Bal(k-1) - PR(k) = Bal(k-1) - (PMT - iBal(k-1)).\n\nThe final payment at time n pays off the remaining balance of the loan so PR(n) = Bal(n-1) and Bal(n) = 0.\n\nThe computation of these interest and principal portions is usually presented in an:\n\nAmortization Table.\n\nPeriod,Beg.

Then we will have: Bal(k) = PV bal(k).",

    "page_content": "We know that a(n,i) is the present value of payments of 1 at the end of each period 1,...,n. This sum can be divided into two parts, the present value of the first k payments which is a(k,i), and the value of last n-k payments at time k, namely a(n-k,i) discounted backed to time 0 by dividing by (1+i)^k: \n\na(n,i) = a(k,i) + a(n\u2212k,i)/(1+i)^k \n\nMultiplying both sides by (1+i)^k/a(n,i) and rearranging yields the formula for bal(k): \n\nbal(k) = a(n\u2212k,i)/a(n,i) = (1+i)^k [1 \u2212 a(k,i)/a(n,i)] \n\nIf the principal of the loan is 1, then each payment is 1/a(n,i). The balance at time k, bal(k), is the present value at that time of the last n-k payments so we have the above formula. \n\nWe will later have occasion to use the portion paid P = P(k) of a loan at time k which is simply one minus the balance of the loan of one at that time: \n\nP = P(k) = 1 \u2212 bal(k) = 1 \u2212 a(n\u2212k,i)/a(n,i) = 1 \u2212 (1+i)^k [1 \u2212 a(k,i)/a(n,i)] \n\nWe have seen that for the case of PV = 1, the n payments PMT = 1/a(n,i) will pay off the loan. That is, the present value of those equal payments is the principal amount 1 of the loan. But there are many other future series of payments--unequal payments--which would also have that present value. For instance, we could pay the same interest on one of i at the end of each period and pay no principal until the end of the nth period when we pay all the principal in one \"balloon payment\" of one. \n\n[Image showing a graph with a horizontal axis labeled 0, 1, 2, ..., n and vertical axis with tick marks labeled i, i, ..., i, 1]",

    "page_content": "That unequal series of payments has the present value of one. But how will we make the balloon payment? Suppose we make a sinking fund deposit of SFF = 1/s(n,i) at times 1,2,...,n. Those deposits will accumulate to 1 at time n to give precisely the balloon payment. But that means that the equal payments at times 1,2,...,n of the interest i plus the sinking fund factor will also have the present value of one (since that pays off that loan). \n\nBut we have another series of equal payments at t = 1,2,...,n with the present value of one, namely the installments of amortize one 1/a(n,i). Hence the two payments must be equal, and we have the important formula: \n\n$$\\frac{1}{a(n,i)} = \\frac{1}{s(n,i)} + i$$\n\nIn words, the installment to amortize one is the sum of sinking fund factor plus the discount rate.",

Cover up PV, and you see the PV = PMT/i. Cover up PMT, and you see that the perpetual payment with the present value PV is PMT = iPV.\n\nBecause of the simplicity of this type of formula, many practitioners would like to put the more complicated formulas encountered before into the same format. That is usually possible, and the results are called \"direct capitalization formulas.\"\n\nConsider, for example, the finite series of payments PMT at t = 1,2,...,n with the present value PV = PMTa(n,i).

The latter is simply the interest on the value V and it is called the \"return ON investment.\" Since the amount V/s(n,i) is the sinking fund deposit which would accumulate to V at time n, it is called the \"capital recovery\" part of the income or the \"return OF investment.\"\n\nI = iV + V/s(n,i) = Return on investment + Return of investment.",
