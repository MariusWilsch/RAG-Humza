The Standard must be applied as a whole. The Standard is not meant to replace or supersede any legal or otherwise required existing area measurement method. It may be used in proposed, new, or existing single-family houses of any style or construction but is not applicable to apartment/multifamily buildings. It does not cover room dimensions.\n\nBefore the original adoption of this Standard in 1996, no national standard existed in the United States for measuring square footage in single-family houses. By contrast, a standard applicable to commercial buildings has been in effect for 80 years. In 1915, the Building Owners and Managers Association International (BOMA) developed a standard method for measuring floor area in office buildings. The BOMA Standard was revised in 1952, 1955, 1971, 1980, 1989, 1996, 2010 and 2017, and now bears the title BOMA 2017 for Office Buildings: Standard Methods of Measurement (ANSI/BOMA Z65.1 2017). Additionally, BOMA issued a square footage measurement methodology for multi-unit residential buildings in 2010 titled, Multi-Unit Residential Buildings: Standard Methods of Measurement (ANSI/BOMA Z65.4-2010).",
