No two properties are identical, and all properties differ in their locations, which is the most important determinant of property value.\n\nThere are several definitions of value sought by a real estate appraisal: Market value \u2013 is the estimated amount for which an asset should exchange on the valuation\n\n4\"\\ \"\"\"\n\ndate between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm\u2019s-length transaction.\n\nPN The et\n\nValue-in-use \u2013 is the Net Present Value of a cash flow that an asset would generate for a specific owner for a specific use. Value-in-use is generally estimated at a use value which is less than the highest-and-best use, and therefore it is generally lower than the market value.",

The value of improvements is referred to by the abbreviation RCNLD (reproduction cost new less depreciation)\n\n\u2022 The sales comparison approach \u2013 this approach compares a subject property's characteristics with those of comparable properties which have recently sold in similar transactions. The process uses one of several techniques to adjust the prices of the comparable transactions according to the presence, absence, or degree of characteristics which influence value.",

We estimate that our losses due to vacancies and non-payment will be 5%. $54,000 *.05 = $2700 $54,000 - $2700= $51,300 for our Gross Operating Income",

Too high of a break-even ratio is a cautionary indicator. We'll assume an annual debt service of $32,000, that management and direct operating costs annually are $47,000. We'll assume a gross operating income of $98,000 annually. Add Debt Service to Operating Expenses and divide by Operating Income: $32,000 + $47,000 / $98,000 = .81 or an 81% Break-Even Ratio",
