    "text": "This tenth edition of Fundamentals of Real Estate Appraisal covers all of the topics included in the Basic Appraisal Principles and Basic Appraisal Procedures course requirements established by the Appraiser Qualifications Board of The Appraisal Foundation.\n\nAs with other areas of real estate practice, the professional appraiser must keep pace with the demands of the marketplace. Technological advances have affected all facets of the real estate transaction, from first client contact to closing. Despite the availability of vast databases of market information, there is no substitute for the well-reasoned opinion of a competent appraiser. Of course, the skill and judgment required to make a reliable appraisal must begin with a thorough knowledge of appraisal principles and procedures.\n\nFundamentals of Real Estate Appraisal is designed to help both the student and the established professional relate appraisal theory and technique to practice. Each chapter begins with a list of the key terms used in the chapter. Because students may not study the chap- ters in chronological order, important terms are emphasized whenever appropriate. Learning objectives help alert the student to the goals of the course material. Information on real estate and the real estate industry is designed to give the student the necessary background in how real estate is defined, marketed, and valued. Explanations of the basic approaches to appraising are thorough, yet concise. Frequent practical examples, including use of forms and data grids, help bring the real world of appraising to the reader. The many exercises and review questions used in the text increase its usefulness as a practical, hands-on tool by requiring reader participation.",

Prices actually dropped 0.4 percent from the second quarter to the third quarter of 2007, which was the first drop in the average home price since 1994, but still kept pace with the cost of living over the previous\n\nyear. Of course, the average takes into account a large variety of proper-\n\nties in a wide range of locations, and individual states and metropolitan areas saw much higher price increases in the same period, while other areas saw modest price increases. The high number of foreclosures reported for 2007, which will be discussed later in this chapter, also affected some states more than others. Under such market conditions the appraisal process is even more important. The appraiser\u2019s analysis always takes into account the fact that market demand fluctuates. Not every property will increase in value, particularly over the short term,",

These and other economic factors contrib- uted to, and in turn were affected by, the collapse of many savings and loan institutions, which ultimately led to the licensing of real estate appraisers.\n\nThe decade began with great promise. The Depository Institutions Deregulation and Monetary Control Act of 1980 greatly expanded the activities of depository institutions and raised the level of federally insured accounts to $100,000. With deregulation, however, came many abuses by institutions that were ineptly and sometimes fraudulently managed. It was an era of increased competition, yet many savings and loan associations were strapped with long-term mortgage loans that yielded considerably less income than was necessary to offer the high short-term interest rates that would attract and keep depositors. To compensate, many institutions began to finance projects based on limited market analysis\u2014projects that would have been risky ventures in the best of markets. Unfortunately, political and economic forces did not work in favor of the risk-takers. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA \u201986) eliminated the tax incentives for many investments, and the economies of the oil-belt states took a downturn. The resulting crash of real estate prices in many parts of the country proved to be the mortal blow for many overextended institutions.",

One of the most tempting loan products was the 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), which offered an initial low interest rate for the first two years of the loan; the \u201coption ARM\u201d even gave the borrower the choice of not paying the interest owed, which was added to the loan balance. The assumption by borrowers was that property appreciation would justify a refinance of the loan before the higher rate kicked in. That assumption proved to be optimistic.\n\nBy the second half of 2006, many borrowers found that they could not make the new, higher loan payments that kicked in after the initial two-year period and started defaulting on their mortgages, with the result that a record number of foreclosures took place in the United States in 2007, and an even greater number was predicted for 2008. In many parts of the country, the record number of properties on the market caused a drop in property values. Many borrowers found that they were left with loan balances greater than the market values of their homes\u2014the condition known as being \u201cupside down\u201d\u2014and simply walked away from their properties. Some of the mortgage fore- closures of the last several years have been attributed to fraudulent transactions, most of which included fraudulent appraisals that mis- stated property values in order to defraud a lender.

The manner in which appraisal data are accumulated and analyzed and the way that the appraiser\u2019s opinion of value is transmitted to the client have undergone a transformation. With the increasing availability and range of use of small, easily programmed office computers, the appraiser must be acquainted with a variety of appraisal-based computer applications. Even the most basic computer purchased today will offer far more speed, capability, and storage capacity than would have been available even a few years ago. Soft- ware is available at increasingly affordable prices and an Internet- capable cell phone can provide immediate access to e-mail, no matter where the appraiser happens to be.

Another important feature of FIRREA now in effect is the requirement that only state-licensed or state-certified appraisers be allowed to per- form real property appraisals in certain federally related transactions.

Most models have the ability to store and recall numbers in a built-in memory, which reduces the need to write down answers to be used in subsequent calculations.\n\nIf you plan to buy a new calculator, however, a good-quality finan- cial calculator might be a better choice.

For example, the arithmetic mean of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 500 (outlier) is 110.\n\nWhen the outlier value of 500 is taken out of the calculation, the mean of the sample is only 12.5.\n\nThe median is not affected by extreme variates as is the arithme-\n\ntic mean. For example, the median in the above item is 15. So, in samples of population where the variances are great, the median is a much better indicator than the average, or mean.\n\nThe mode might represent an actual situation. For example, the population of apartments per building might have an arithmetic mean of 11.25, a median of 12.5, and a mode of 12. It is more realistic to discuss 12 units per building than 11.25 or 12.5. The mode, therefore, is most useful when a number of units have the same value.",

In ordinary computation, range merely describes the difference between the highest and lowest price; it does not lend itself to further analysis. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a statistical approach; the appraiser calculates the standard deviation of dispersion within the population.\n\nTo illustrate, in a normal distribution of values, the shape assumed would be a normal curve, or bell curve, as shown in Figure 2.10.\n\nIn the normal curve, we know how much of any given area lies within given standard deviations from the mean. The mean deviation tells how much on the average each individual score varies from its own mean. The usefulness of standard deviation lies in the fact that approximately 34 percent of the population will fall between the mean and one standard deviation. Therefore, 68 percent of the population will fall between plus or minus one standard deviation, approximately 95 percent between plus or minus two standard deviations, and almost",

This technique is called multiple linear regression analysis.\n\nRegression analysis makes use of basic principles of statistics, some of which are discussed in this chapter, to analyze comparable sales and determine line-item adjustments. A single regression analy- sis can consist of millions of individual calculations. Until a few years ago, the rigorous computations required to make use of this technique made it impractical for most fee appraising. Such calculations were simply not feasible, given the limited capability of even the state-of- the-art personal computers of ten years ago. With today\u2019s equipment and software, however, they are a relatively trivial matter. Software with built-in regression analysis can enter recommended adjustment values automatically as the appraiser completes the URAR form. The result is not only to make the appraisal process more efficient but also to give the appraiser\u2019s value conclusions a high degree of accuracy, even in difficult rural markets where good comparable sales data can be hard to find.",

Proponents of the statistical approach claim that it offers an objective method of analysis, and that any appraiser can master the technique by taking a course in elementary statistics.\n\nIn statistical analysis, three common measures of central tendency are used\u2014the mean, the median, and the mode. The arithmetic mean is calculated by summing the data and dividing it by the number of items or variates. The mean is influenced by extremes or outliers; that is, exceptionally high or low values will inordinately affect the mean. If the data is skewed or strung out further to the left or right, the mean will be shifted in the same direction. The median is the middle value in an array of numbers. Tt is not affected by extremes, but it is affected by the data being skewed to the low or the high sides. The mode is the number which occurs most frequently in a series. The data tends to cluster about the mode.",

The appraiser\u2019s estimate of property value has a significant effect on many aspects of a real estate transaction, whether the transaction involves a sale, a transfer, a mortgage loan, or a property tax assess- ment or is for some other purpose. The appraiser must act as a dis- interested third party; for this reason, the appraiser\u2019s compensation is not based on the estimated value of the property being appraised. With no vested interest in the estimation of value, the appraiser should be able to objectively evaluate the property\u2019s relative merits, appeal, and value.",

The term appraisal is used to refer to both the process by which the appraiser reaches certain conclusions (USPAP Standard 1) and the written report in which those conclusions are communicated (USPAP Standard 2). With an objective, well-researched, and carefully documented appraisal, all parties involved, whether in a sale, lease, or other transaction, are aided in the decision-making process.\n\nA reliable opinion of value is sought by many parties for many dif- ferent reasons. The seller wants to know the value of the real estate determine an appropriate selling price, the buyer wants to pay no more than necessary, and the broker wants to realize the maximum commission. Financial institutions, which need appraisals to assist in their underwriting decisions regardless of the loan amount, insist on an appraisal to determine the amount of money they should lend to a credit applicant. Appraisals are also used to estimate value for taxation and insurance purposes and in condemnation proceedings.",

Landlord and tenant are free to make whatever agreement they desire with regard to ownership of trade fixtures. If they have made no lease agreement or if the lease is silent on the subject of a particular fixture, state law will determine ownership of the fixture and thus whether it may be removed by the tenant.\n\nA tenant usually may remove a trade fixture before the end of the lease term if the fixture was installed for purposes of trade, manufac- ture, ornament, or domestic use, and if it can be removed without",

Land area is divided into towmnships measured and numbered starting at the intersection of a base line running east to west and a principal meridian running north to south (see Figure 3.3). Lines running east and west, parallel to the base line and spaced six miles apart, are called township lines. Lines that run north and south, parallel to the principal meridian, are also six miles apart and are called range lines. When the horizontal township lines and the vertical range lines intersect, they form squares, called town- ships. A township is divided into 36 sections. A section of land contains 640 acres and is 1 mile square, or 5,280 feet by 5,280 feet.\n\nSections are numbered 1 through 36, as shown to the right in Fig- ure 3.4. Section 1 is always at the northeast, or upper righthand corner of the township. The numbering proceeds right to left, left to right for the next row, right to left for the row after that, and so on. Each sec- tion in a township, in turn, can be divided into halves, quarters, and even smaller parcels based on compass point directions, as shown to the left in Figure 3.4.",

Fee simple ownership includes the right to use the land now and for an indefinite period of time in the future. If there are restrictions on the ownership right, it is considered a fee simple abso- Tute.\"Ownership that is limited in some way is a fee simple qualified. Any limitation on property use that could result in the loss of the own- ership right is called a fee simple defeasible.\n\n? Examples of limitations on fee simple title are the condition prec- edent (or fee simple determinable), stipulating some action that must be taken before ownership will take effect, and the condition subse- quent (or fee simple conditional), specifying an action or activity that, if performed, will allow the previous owner to retake possession of the property through legal action. The requirement that an heir achieve a certain age before title can be transferred is an example of a condition precedent. An example of a condition subsequent is a requirement that alcohol not be consumed on premises given to a church; if the condi- tion is broken, the former owner can bring legal action to retake the property.",

The last survivor takes title in severalty and has all the rights of individual ownership, including the right to pass the property to his or her heirs (see Figure 3.9). In most states, the right of survivor- ship automatically accompanies title taken in a joint tenancy. In other states (such as North Carolina), the right of survivorship must be spe- cifically mentioned in the instrument of conveyance (deed).",

One may be caused by the prospective buyer\u2019s failure to qualify for financing, and another may be caused by a problem with the condition of the property that is revealed only after an inspection. Still another roadblock may be created by a prior property transfer that affects the ownership interest of the present owner, preventing the owner from conveying good title to the buyer. Because the appraiser is interested in any factor that can impede a transaction and possibly affect prop- erty value, the appraiser should understand how a real estate transac- tion is accomplished and how title to real estate is transferred.\n\nIn this chapter, you will learn the necessary provisions of some of\n\nthe most frequently encountered documents that are included in a real estate transaction, from the provisions of a typical purchase contract to the transfer of title by deed. You also will learn the common provisions a lease of real property.",

The lender will hire an appraiser to perform an appraisal so that the lender has some assurance that the property\u2019s purchase price is an accurate reflection of its probable market value. The lender will require that title insurance be obtained and will also insist on being named as an \u201cadditional insured\u201d on the borrower\u2019s hazard insurance policy.\n\nincidental contracts that will flow from.\n\nOf course, there are many the purchase transaction, such as the hiring of a moving company to remove the seller\u2019s possessions from the property, and another com- pany to bring in the buyer\u2019s furnishings.

The offer must be made and accepted freely and voluntarily, without any threat of harm, undue influ- ence, mistake or fraudulent misrepresentation on the part of either party.\n\niN PRACTICE\n\nFraud in the inducement is the legal term for the use of improper influence to persuade someone to sign a contract. Foreclosure fraud occurs in this way when a homeowner in distress is persuaded to transfer title to property to someone who promises to assist the homeowner in avoiding foreclosure. The new owner of record then mortgages the property for the maximum amount, absconds with the money, and leaves the person defrauded in worse financial shape than before.\n\ni : 3. There must be a lawful object to the contract. A court of law will not enforce a contract to commit a crime.\n\n4. Some form of consideration, whether an obligation or payment, must support the contract. This mutuality of contract can be a promise to do something in the future (or refrain from doing something) by one party, with monetary payment to be made by the other party when the promise is performed.\n\n5. In some cases, such as a contract for the sale of real estate, the j iti contract may have to be in writing.

The requirements for a valid deed and the most frequently used types of deeds are explained next.\n\nRequirements for a Valid Deed\n\nA deed is a written instrument by which an owner of real estate inten- tionally conveys to a purchaser his or her right, title, or interest in a parcel of real estate. The owner of the real estate is referred to as the grantor, and the person who acquires title is called the grantee. In order to be legally valid,\n\na deed must be in writing;\n\nit must include a description of the parties (full name and marital status);\n\nthe grantor must be legally capable of executing the deed;\n\nthe property must be adequately described;\n\nit must contain a granting clause using the necessary words conveyance (such as the word grant);",

In a lease of real estate, the property owner is the lessor (landlord) and the party acquiring the right of use is the lessee (tenant). The consideration for the right of use usually is the rent paid by the tenant, although sometimes a tenant will provide services, such as maintenance or property manage- ment, in exchange for the right to occupy the property. A lease must be in writing if it will not be completed within one year. This includes the period of time after the lease agreement is signed but before the lease term begins. So, a lease for a nine-month period of occupancy that won\u2019t start until four months after the lease is signed must be in writing.",

There are fewer legal protections for the lessee because a commercial property tenant usually is a business person who is considered to be more sophisticated than the typical consumer. The primary concerns cov- ered in a commercial lease include an accurate identification of the property and parties involved in the lease transaction, term of the lease, compensation to the lessor, tenant improvements, and liabilities of the parties.\n\nCommercial buildings may be leased with minimal interior finish- ing, allowing the layout of work spaces and choice of flooring, wall coverings, and other finishing materials to be accomplished by the tenant\u2014typically at the tenant\u2019s expense.

Office cubicles usually are constructed with movable (and removable) panels and a retail store will use freestanding dis- plays that can be rearranged as needed and removed when necessary.

With a ground lease, the owner of the land leases the right to erect a structure on the property for a specified term, typically 99 years (which may be the maximum allowed by state law). When the ground lease terminates, the tenant must vacate the prem- ises, and the structure becomes the property of the landlord. Although it may seem that the landlord stands to reap a windfall when the ground lease terminates, the structure may have outlived its useful life and be a burden rather than a benefit to the landlord. If the structure is still viable, it is also likely that the most suitable tenant for the struc- ture in the future will be the tenant who erected the improvements, who may be induced to perform any necessary renovations and begin a new lease term.\n\nThe reason the ground lease has become attractive to residential developers is that it can be a way to provide housing at a more afford- able cost. Most Americans change their residences a number of times and rent or own at various times. One way to minimize the expense of ownership is to rent, rather than purchase, the land that the living space occupies, and, as a practical matter, an ownership interest that will last for 50 years or longer may be more than enough to satisfy the needs of the majority of homeowners. The ground lease already is common in areas that have limited space and high demand for housing.",

Whether a detached single-family house, a highrise condo- minium, a town house, a farm, a ranch, or even a houseboat, such a purchase often is well rewarded at the time of a subsequent sale, when the property\u2019s value may have increased substantially over its initial purchase price. Less frequently, particularly if a resale occurs within only a year or two, the property may not command a high enough sales price to cover both the seller\u2019s original purchase price and the expenses of sale (such as a broker\u2019s commission).\n\nOf course, commercial property transactions are also important to the parties involved, and commercial property values can be even more volatile than those of other forms of real estate. The favorable economic indicators that encourage office and retail development may lead to overbuilt markets and empty buildings. Commercial property is typically leased, and unfavorable economic conditions can quickly lead to vacant storefronts and lowered lease rates.",

The factors that compose an efficient market include the following:\n\n# Products that are readily exchangeable for other products of the kind\n\nsame\n\n= Ample supply of knowledgeable buyers and sellers\n\nLittle or no government regulation influencing value\n\n#\n\n= Relatively stable prices\n\n# FEasy product supply and transport\n\n* A market that is at its most efficient is said to be a perfect market. Unfortunately, the market for real estate is far from perfect.\n\nWe can begin to define a real estate market by understanding the special factors that influence real estate as a commodity. Every parcel of real estate is considered unique and thus not interchangeable with any other parcel. Buyers and sellers of real estate frequently are unso- phisticated and lack knowledge of the factors that make one parcel of real estate more valuable than another. The number of buyers and sell- ers frequently moves away from a state of equilibrium to create either a seller\u2019s market (many more buyers than sellers) or a buyer\u2019s market (many more sellers than buyers). Real estate is intensely regulated, with regard both to the uses to which it can be put and to the man- ner in which its ownership can be transferred. As a result of all these factors, as well as the fact that real estate is immovable, prices can be highly volatile.",

For products other than real estate, the location of the product to be sold affects shipping costs and thus is only one of a number of determinants that affect value. The most important single factor in determining real estate value, how ever, is location. Land cannot be delivered to a location where it is in short supply or warehoused until it is needed. The seller of real estate can improx.'e the property by preparing it for building or constructing or renovating improvements. The seller also can use advertising and other promotional tools to make the property\u2019s availability known to the greatest number of potential buyers. The one thing the seller o real estate cannot do is change the property\u2019s location.

The booming resi- dential real estate market of the first part of this century, helped by low interest rates and adjustable-rate mortgages, was followed by the subprime lending crisis and resulted in a record number of foreclo- sures and many vacant homes.\n\nAn absorption analysis usually is performed as part of a feasibil- ity study, used to predict the likely success of a proposed real estate development. The feasibility study also includes a cost analysis of the proposed construction and projected return to investors.\n\nOf course, the most complete statistics and best analyses are use- less without a thoroughly up-to-date knowledge of the political climate and government forces, both local and otherwise, that may result in regulations affecting property ownership and use. A feasibility study of area growth projections for a new subdivision is incomplete if it does not take into account a proposed highway expansion adjacent to the site. Without that knowledge, the use proposed by the owner or prospective purchaser might be meaningless. With that knowledge, a recommendation that the proposed use change from residential to commercial could result in a project several times as valuable.",

There is no one location or institution that comprises either the money market or the capital market and no sharp line of demarca- tion in the kinds of instruments handled by each.\n\nCompeting Investments\n\n\u201cInvestors generally fall into one of two groups, debt investors and equity investors. Debt investors are the more conservative of the two groups - because they take a passive rather than an active role in management of their investments and demand a security interest in property being financed. Equity investors, who make use of what is termed venture capital, take a more active, though unsecured, role in the investment.",

    "text": "124 CHAPTER 5\n\nElements That Create Value\n\nFor real estate or any commodity to have value, the four elements that create value must be present. These elements are demand, utility, scarcity, and transferability (DUST). The element of demand is pres- ent when someone wants the property and has the financial ability to purchase it. Utility means that the property can serve a useful purpose. Scarcity is present when the property is in short supply relative to demand. Transferability means that title to the property can be moved readily from one person or entity to another. When all four elements of value are present, property has a value that may be estimated by an appraiser.\n\nWhen a good or service can be used to acquire another good or service, the commodities have what is termed value in exchange. A marketplace exists when there is no impediment to the ready exchange of goods or services. Most often, goods or services are exchanged for their equivalent in legal tender\u2014money. The amount of money required to bring about the exchange is the cost of the good or service. As you will learn later in this chapter, the cost of goods or services will be affected by both the number of potential purchasers (demand) and quantity of the goods or services (supply). Because it reflects con- ditions in the marketplace, value in exchange is what is described as market value.",

The knowledge of precisely what those factors are, and how they influence and can be expected to influence property value, is part of what lends credence to the appraiser\u2019s opinion of market value.\n\n.\n\n:\n\n\u2018\n\n.\n\nThe basic value principles are interrelated, and their relative impor- tance will vary depending on particular local conditions. Supply and demand may be the strongest factor in a popular resort area; in an urban area, a period of economic recession may deter development of new stores. Even climatic or geological conditions are important, as when unexpected heavy rainfall creates the threat of destructive mudslides.\n\n.\n\n\u2018\n\ntask, then, to consider the subject property in\n\nis the\n\n1t appraiser\u2019s light of all the factors applicable to the property\u2019s type and location, as well as the purpose of the appraisal.

The expectations of a real estate buyer will depend to some extent on the type of property pur- chased. The buyer of a single-family residence usually expects to take advantage of the property\u2019s amenities as a shelter, as well as the pres- tige value of ownership.

Real estate has historically proved to be a generally appreciating asset. As such it is usually bought with the expectation of future higher value. This anticipation of higher value is usually fulfilled because land offers a fixed supply to satisfy what has proved to be a continually growing demand. However, anticipation may also lower value if property rights are expected to be restricted or if the property somehow becomes less",

A house that has not been well maintained but is in a neighborhood of well-kept homes will benefit from the overall good impression created by the neighborhood and its probable desirability. This is an example of the principle of progres- sion. In an example of the principle of regression, a house that has been meticulously maintained but is in a neighborhood of homes that have not received regular repair will suffer from the generally unfavor- able impression created. In the same way, an elaborate mansion on a large lot with a spacious lawn will be worth more in a neighborhood of similar homes than it would be in a neighborhood of more modest homes on smaller lots.

Specific data about the property, general data about the surrounding area, and data applicable to the appraisal approach being used all must be researched.\n\nin\n\non\n\nThe flowchart in Figure 6.1 outlines the eight steps to be followed the appraisal process.

Identifying the appraisal problem includes the following:\n\n@ Identification and location of the real estate.

All sources should be double-checked against other sources, especially when obtaining the sales price of a comparable property. In such a case, at least one of the sources should be a party to the transaction.\n\n4. Analyze the data.\n\nInterpreting the relevant data is just as important as collect- ing it. In virtually every appraisal, the appraiser will begin this part of the appraisal process by conducting a highest and best use analysis that considers the market forces that influence the subject property to determine the property\u2019s most profitable use on which to base the final opinion of value. A thorough under- standing of the market components that affect the value of the subject property is so important that the highest and best use study is often shown in the appraisal flowchart as an additional step, labeled productivity market analysis. Regardless of how it is categorized, the analysis requires that the appraiser take into account the physical, legal, and locational attributes pres- ent in the real estate asset\u2014the property that is the subject of the appraisal\u2014and consider the extent to which those attributes fulfill the requirements of the marketplace. In other words, does the subject property\u2019s highest and best use satisfy the human needs that are revealed by such economic indicators as supply, demand, and absorption? The appraiser may conclude that the highest and best use of the land is not its present use.",

    "text": "7 BEGINNING THE APPRAISAL PROCESS\n\n. Purpose and Use of the A P the Appraisal\n\nThe appraiser begins the appraisal process by determining the scope of work required, based on the property being appraised, the type of value sought, and the purpose of the appraisal. Market value is the most frequently sought appraised value. Other types of value are high- lighted in Chapter 5.\n\nInterests to Be Appraised\n\nThe form of legal interest being appraised must always be specified. Chapter 3 described the various interests in real property, including fee - simple, life estate, leasehold estate, and leased fee estate. Each of these - interests can be appraised. The estimated value of the interest depends on the term of the interest, any limitations on property use during that term, whether the interest is transferable, and other factors. .\n\nA fee simple estate, or fee simple absolute, is the only form of ownership completely free of any other interest or estate. Even the owner of a fee simple absolute estate is subject to zoning and other governmental regulations, however. The appraisal also might be based on a partial interest, such as mineral rights.\n\nA leasehold estate always has a definite termination date and can be valued for its remaining term. The leased fee estate that is retained by the owner of the fee simple interest also can be valued. Valuation of leasehold and leased fee estate is discussed in Chapter 16, \u201cAppraising Partial Interests.\u201d",

If that person is elderly, the life estate obviously has less value than it would if the measuring life were that of a healthy 20-year-old who did not engage in any unusually hazardous activities.\n\nDate of the Opinion of Value\n\nAn appraisal may be made as of any date\u2014past, present, or future. Most often, current value is sought, and the appraiser selects the latest date possible. Most appraisers select the date of inspection of the sub- ject property as the effective date of the appraisal. Occasionally, as in a legal proceeding, the appraiser is asked to estimate value as of a past date. Because the appraiser then has a history of market information to consider, such an appraisal may be considerably less complex than one requiring an estimate based on a future date. To estimate future value, the appraiser must exirapolate future market behavior based on current information and projected trends, an extremely difficult task. In any event, to avoid misleading the client, the appraiser should ' ; always state the assumptions under which the appraisal is made and any limitations on the use of the appraisal.",

The GSEs and other agencies do not expect an appraisal to be an all-encompassing process or the appraiser to spend an unlimited amount of time in preparing an appraisal report. The latest revision of the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (URAR) form released by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac incorporates a Statement of Assumptions and Limiting Conditions to help define the appraiser\u2019s role and specify the conditions under which the appraisal is made. Fannie Mae does not allow additions or deletions to the form when it is used as part of a Fannie Mae-related appraisal. For other transactions, the appraiser may draft a customized set of limiting conditions or add to this list, as appropriate for a particular property. Figure 6.2 shows the last three pages of the six-page URAR form, which replaced all previous versions of the URAR form for Fannie Mae appraisals as of November 1, 2005. The first three pages of the form, which include property information, data analysis, and opinion of value, appear throughout the remainder",

The approach given the most weight, however, would probably be the cost approach, because the high cost of constructing a similar new building would probably be the most significant selling factor.",

The handling of architectural details gives the traditional house its unique flavor. Fortunately, the detailing for many traditional houses no longer need be handcrafted because good reproductions are now mass produced.

A distinctive contemporary look relies on the straightforward expression of the structural system itself for major design impact.\u201cOne great benefit of contemporary residential archi tecture is its responsiveness to indoor-outdoor living. Walls of sliding- glass doors, large windows, skylights, decks, terraces, and atriums all contribute to this relationship.\n\nToday\u2019s new materials and modern techniques can make a big differ- ence in the way houses are designed and built. The modern house, whether its style is contemporary or traditional, can exhibit the latest conveniences and building innovations.\n\nLarge areas of double-paned glass open houses to sun, light, and view without letting in cold drafts. A good modern house has central heating, which enables homeowners to enjoy big rooms and large win- dows without discomfort. Air-conditioning has eliminated the need for cross-ventilation from two exposures in every room, although a house providing cross-ventilation will be attractive to the energy-conscious consuiner.",

The first step in erecting exterior walls is the framing. \u201cThe skeleton members of a building to which the interior and exterior walls are attached are called its frame. The walls of a frame are formed by vertical mem- bers called siuds [15], which are spaced at even intervals and are attached to the sill. Building codes typically require that for a one- story house, the stud spacing may not exceed 24 inches on center. For a two-story house, the spacing may not exceed 16 inches. Studs rest on plates [12] that are secured to and rest on the foundation wall [4]. In constructing walls and floors, the builder will install firestops [43] as needed or required. These are boards or blocks nailed hori- zontally between studs or joists to stop drafts and retard the spread of fire. Window and door openings are framed in with wood boards. The horizontal board across the top of 2 window or door opening is called the header [26]; the horizontal board across the bottom of the opening is called the sill. .",

Rock wool and fiberglass are commonly used insulation materials. Combinations of materials, sucl as fiberglass wrapped in aluminum foil or rock wool formed into batt sections that can be placed between the studs, are also available.\n\n#The effectiveness of insulation depends on its resistance to heat flow\u2014its R-value\u2014rather than just on its thickness. Different insulat- ing materials have different R-values; therefore, different thicknesses are required to do the same job. The larger the R-value, the more resistance to heat flow and the better the insulation. R-values are add tive. For example, if you already have an R-13 value of insulation in a particular location and you want it to be R-35, you can use a layer of R-22 to achieve an R-35 value.",

Plasterboard is finished by a process known as taping and floating. Taping covers the joints between the sheets of plaster- board. Floating is the smoothing out of the walls by the application of a plaster texture over the joints and rough edges where nails attach the plasterboard to the wall studs. Texturing created by a heavy layer of a plaster-like finish coat may be applied with a roller onto the plas- terboard prior to painting. \u201c",

The danger to adults includes high blood pressure, memory and concentration prob- lems, and difficulty during pregnancy. The danger to chil- dren includes damage to the brain and nervous system, behavior and learning problems, slowed growth, and hearing loss. Deteriorating paint releases lead; renova- tions can release large amounts of lead into the home as well as the surrounding soil. Encapsulation using special paints that prevent lead from leaching through to the surface may be the best preventative. As of 1978, the use of lead-based paint in housing has been prohibited by the federal government. It has been estimated that 83 percent of homes built prior to 1978 (64 million homes in all) contain lead-based paint. The Residential Lead-Based Paint Hazard Reduction Act of 1992 requires disclosure of the possible presence of lead-based paint in homes built before 1978. As of Sep- tember 6, 1996, sellers and landlords owning five or more residential dwelling units must comply with disclosure requirements; the law went into effect on December 6, 1996, for sellers and landlords owning four or fewer residential dwelling units. Compliance is the responsibility of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Informa- tion on legal requirements is available from the National Lead Information Center, 202-659-1192, or www.epa.gov/ lead/nlic.htm, as well as EPA branches and state health departments. While the law does not require that the seller or landlord conduct any testing or hazard reduction, the seller or landlord must disclose any known presence of lead and provide copies",

Sometimes, however, the different rights of ownership are separated and held by more than one\n\nperson. A frequent example of separation of rights of ownership with respect to residential property involves mineral rights. In areas that are suspected of containing oil or gas deposits, a transfer of title to real estate frequently will withhold mineral rights, title to which is retained by the transferor (the person making the transfer). The right to test for and remove the minerals may never be exercised; however, the fact that mineral rights have been separated from the other rights of own- ership should be noted by the appraiser. The appraiser should also note any effect that less than fee simple ownership may be expected to have on value. If all properties in the area carry a similar reserva- tion of mineral or other rights, there is likely to be little or no effect on market value.",

If the property has already been leased, however, the leased fee estate retained by the lessor (landlord) must be valued in light of the existing lease. The lessee\u2014 the holder of the lease\u2014has the leasehold interest at the contract or scheduled rent agreed to between lessor and lessee. The leasehold interest will have value depending on the relationship of the contract rent to the prevailing market rent (an estimate of a property\u2019s ren potential). If market rents are higher than the rent the current lease provides, the difference between them determines the value of the leasehold interest.\n\nIn all of these examples, an appraisal must take into account the exact property interest that is being valued.",

When the oil industry also proved vulnerable, some workers stayed on, but many returned to their for- i mer places of residence. The same phenomenon occurred as the new century began, when some of the high-flying high-tech companies in the San Francisco Bay Area succumbed to the effects of too much competition and vastly overoptimistic market projections.

At that point, the houses i the neighborhood tend to stabilize at their highest monetary value and prices rarely fluctuate downward.

The process of decling can be accelerated by the availability of new housing nearby, succe: sive ownership of homes by lower-income residents who may not b able to afford the increasing maintenance costs of older homes, an the conversion of some properties to rental units, which may not b properly maintained.

Using this approach, the appraiser collects sales data on comparable nearby properties that have sold recently, then makes market-derived adjust- ments reflecting individual differences between the subject and com- parables. After necessary adjustments have been made, the appraiser selects the resultant value indication that best reflects the market value of the subject property.

Typically, what is most important to the home purchaser is the market value of the property relative to the value of other similar properties in the neighborhood, most of which typically also are owner-occupied. Of course, even owner/occupants are con- cerned with their financial ability to carry the costs of owning a home, from mortgage and tax payments to utility bills and ordinary costs of maintenance.

The acceptability of the sale from a time standpoint will depend on the number of sales that have taken place and the volatility of the marketplace. Within a normal market, sales no more than six months before the date of appraisal generally are acceptable. In a slow- moving market, the appraiser may have to refer to comparable sales from as long as a year earlier. In that event, the appraiser probably will need to make an adjustment to allow for the time factor. If other types of properties have increased in value over the same period, a general rise in prices may be indicated. The appraiser must determine whether the property in question is part of the general trend and, if it is, adjust the sales price of the comparable accordingly. This adjustment answers the question, \u201cHow much would this comparable property probably sell for in today\u2019s market?\u201d",

Infor- mation on pending sales would ordinarily not be used and would be exceedingly difficult to come by in any event, given that real estate bro- \u2018 Ieers, attorneys, and other agents of the principals could be in breach of their fiduciary duties if they revealed such information. Nevertheless,: the fact that some sales are pending could be a strong indicator that a previously depressed market is on the rebound. In the same way, ask- ing prices of properties currently listed but not yet sold are generally not considered in a property appraisal, but could be very revealing of the current market status. If there have been relatively few sales in the area recently, for instance, and current asking prices are lower than previous sales prices, that fact should be noted by the appraiser. When combined with other factors, such as increasing length of time on the market, the appraiser may have reason to discount the value of previ- ously recorded sales.",

Nevertheless, there may still be some possibility of a changed use that could result in higher income potential for the property.

This is especially true during a period of intense competition that results from an overbuilt market or economic downturn. Then, a state institution that has fallen into disuse may be deemed entirely appropriate for redevelopment into condo- miniums, rental units, and a golf course.

Each comparable property is lik- ened as much as possible to the subject property. In adjusting the sales price of a comparable property, lump-sum dollar amounts or percentages are customarily used. Adjustments are always applied to the sales price of the comparable property, ot the value of the subject property. If the comparable property is inferior in some respect to the subject property, its sales price is increased by an appropriate dollar amount or percentage. If the comparable property is superior in some category, its sales price is decreased. In the adjustment process, the appraiser then uses the modified sales prices of comparable properties in estimating the value of the subiect property.\n\nIn comparing site data, whether vacant or improved, the appraiser\n\nshould take care always to use the same units of measurement. For example, the sales price of a site may be expressed as a certain amount per front foot, based on the site\u2019s street frontage.

In this chapter, the distinction between repro- duction and replacement cost and the methods of computing building cost are explained. In Chapter 11, the different types of depreciation are analyzed.\n\n[# COST APPROACH FORMULA\n\nTo reach an opinion of value by the cost approach, the appraiser (1) calculates the cost to reproduce or replace the existing structures, (2) subtracts from the cost estimate any loss in value because of deprecia- tion, and (3) adds the value of the site alone to the depreciated cost figure. The basic principle involved is the principle of substitution The cost of a new building is substituted for that of the existing one, with some adjustment to compensate for depreciation of the existing building due to general deterioration and other factors.\n\nThe cost approach can be expressed as a formula:\n\nReproduction or Accrued Site Property replacement cost \u2014 o + = R depreciation value value of improvements\n\nOne drawback to the cost approach is that the value of a ne structure is presumed to be equal to its cost. This may not be true i the structure does not represent the highest and best use of the site In other words, the value of an inappropriate structure, such as a larg hotel on a little-traveled back road, may not equal the cost to build it",

Although cost estimates of high-ceilinged structures may utilize the cubic-foot method of cstimating reproduction cost, a height adjustmeny \u2018 made to the figure arrived at by the square-foot method is usually suf- ficient.\n\nBoth the square-foot method of estimating reproduction cost an the cubic-foot method may be referred to by the term comparativ unit method. If that term is used, the appraiser should be sure to stat the unit of measurement (square feet or cubic feet).\n\nThe following floor plan is that of a factory building with contiguous office space that approximates the example building shown in Figure 10.2.

An example of such an appraisal form, the Uniform Residential Appraisal Report (URAR), appears at the end of Chapter 15.\n\nWith the URAR form, gross living area (derived by using the out- side measurements of the house, less nonliving areas) is multiplied by cost per square foot. That figure is then added to the cost of nonliving areas and other improvements, such as garage and patio, to arrive at the total estimated cost new of all improvements. Note: Even though the URAR form provides space for a cost approach calculation of property value, it is not required unless the appraiser feels that it is necessary.\n\nThe Smith residence is being appraised. The house has 1,800 square feet of living area, based on exterior building measurements. Current construction cost is $73 per square foot. Garage space of 550 square feet has a current construction cost of $25 per square foot. The house has a patio valued at $1,500. Other site improvements, including a driveway and landscaping, are valued at $8,500. What is the reproduction cost of the Smith property? The have a present reproduction cost new of $131,400",

All o the components are itemized, each is measured where necessary, ani the current construction cost per unit of measure of each compone; is multiplied by the number of measured units of that component i the subject building.\n\nThe unit-in-place method provides a much more detailed break down of the type of structure being appraised than does the square. foot method. As such, it is much more time-consuming but is likely f be more accurate than the square-foot method. As with the square-foor method, the unit-in-place method relies on cost manuals, with som allowances made (if necessary) for regional differences or recent co. increases.\n\nA detailed breakdown of residential building costs (such as tha provided in the publications of the Marshall and Swift Company) typi cally includes the following building components: :",

As a result, thi: is the most comprehensive and accurate method of estimating repro: duction cost.\n\nUsing the quantity survey method, direct costs (those related t materials and labor) are computed much more precisely than in th unit-in-place method. Every stage of construction is broken dow: into separate costs for materials and labor. The required expenditur for the electrical system, for instance, will take into account both th cost of materials at an estimated price per unit and the cost of labos for the required number of hours at the going rate per hour. Thu: the appraiser must be able to estimate material unit quantities an costs as well as work times and labor rates. Indirect costs (thos involved in necessary but not construction-related expenses, such a surveys, payroll taxes, and profit) are also added.

The classic example is the cosmetic \u201cfixer-upper\u201d that is structurally sound but needs cleaning, minor repairs, and new paint to bring its appear- ance and appeal up to the standard of other properties in the neigh- borhood.\n\nIf a defect is not economically justified, it is considered incurable physical deterioration. Examples of incurable physical deterioration include those building components that could be repaired or replaced only with great difficulty, such as a foundation that has suffered mud- slide damage. Ordinarily, these building components are expected to last for the life of the building.\n\n\\\n\nLoss caused by physical deterioration can be valued as a percent- age of total building value, or the appraiser can value each depreciated item separately.",

It is economic when market conditions lower demand, as during a reces- sion. It is political when a nearby land use is changed by the local governing body to permit a less desirable use, such as a landfill. An example of how the national political process can affect local land values was the closure of military bases across the country a few years ago.

    "text": "Evaluating Depreciation Sources\n\nCare must be taken to determine whether the cause of external obso- lescence has already been reflected in the appraiser\u2019s estimate of land value. While it is true that land does not depreciate, the value of land can (and does) go down. Because land is always valued as if vacant, external obsolescence frequently affects highest and best use, result- ing in the existing improvements being an overimprovement. In that instance, the depreciation is functional, not external.\n\nDepreciation is the most difficult part of the cost approach equa- tion to estimate accurately. The older the structure, the more likely it is to have deteriorated to a marked degree, often in ways not eas- ily observable (such as corroded plumbing lines or cracked plaster hidden by wallpaper or paneling). Physical deterioration begins the moment an improvement is constructed and continues until it is no longer usable.\n\nDepreciation (deterioration and obsolescence) may vary signifi- cantly, depending on market conditions as of the date of valuation. If demand exceeds supply, buyers may overlook many \u201ctypical\u201d items of depreciation. For example, a single-family house located on a busy street normally suffers from external obsolescence due to the proxim- ity of the traffic and all of the obnoxious and noxious conditions asso- ciated with traffic.

In this - example, the building is now worth $720,000: Reproduction cost $800,000 Less total accrued depreciation ($800,000 x 0.10) - 80,000 Building value by the cost approach $720,000",

Outmoded plumbing fixtures are usually easily replaced. Room function might be redefined at no cost if the basic room layout allowed for it, such as converting a bedroom adjacent to a kitchen to use as a family room. A closet converted to a darkroom might be easily converted back to a closet.\n\nLoss in value from an item of curable functional obsolescence takes into account the fact that an item of remodeling or repair is more expensive when done separately than when work of the same design and specifications is performed as part of the construction of the entire structure. Thus, loss in value is the difference between the increase in total reproduction cost that would cure the item and what it would cost to cure only that item. If a kitchen suffers from lack of modern cabinets and appliances, its depreciated value is the difference between the addition to reproduction cost represented by a modern- ized kitchen and the cost to modernize the kitchen separately. If a modern kitchen would add $9,000 to reproduction cost and the cost as of the same date to modernize the existing kitchen by remodeling is $10,500, then $1,500 is the loss in value due to an out-of-date kitchen. Remodeling an existing structure to cure a defect is more expensive with regard to that defect than if an entirely new structure could be built without the defect.",

It is necessary to have comparable properties that pos- sess the same defect and some that do not, to isolate the difference in rental value due solely to that cause.

Total amount of curable and short-lived incurable physical deterioration is $4,240 ($1,440, + $720 + $1,680 + $400).\n\nBecause long-lived incurable physical deterioration is usually based on general wear and tear of items not separately measured by the appraiser, the age-life method of computing depreciation is applied to the reproduction cost remaining after the full value of other items of physical deterioration has been subtracted.\n\nIn the previous example, the house is 10 years old (also its effective age)\n\nand has an estimated remaining economic life of 40 years. The appraiser has determined that the amount of long-lived incurable physical deterio- ration is 10/50, or 20 percent of the house's remaining reproduction cost. After the full value of all items of physical deterioration is subtracted, the remaining reproduction cost is $183,950 ($192,750 \u2014 $8,800). The amount attributable to long-lived incurable physical deterioration is $36,790 (1/5 of $183,950). Total depreciation due to physical deterioration is $41,030 ($4,240 +$36,790).",

The accuracy of an appraisal using this approach depends on the appraiser\u2019s use of reli- able adjustment values. Because adjustments must reflect the activities of buyers and sellers in the market, it is the appraiser\u2019s job to research, analyze, and draw supportable conclusions from market-derived data. Unfortunately, the value of the same feature may vary for different types, sizes, and overall values of property. Until an appraiser has the background of many appraisals in a given area, more comparable properties will have to be studied than just the three to six presented in the typical appraisal report. If the appraiser completes an adjust- ment chart for as many as 10 to 20 or more properties, a market pat- tern may be more evident, and with better documentation, the value of individual differences may be estimated fairly accurately. When there have been few recent sales, the appraiser\u2019s own files can be the best source of adjustment values.",

The recommended sequence of adjustments is crucial, because an adjustment in either of the first two adjustment catego- ries\u2014\ufb01nangmg and time\u2014usually is based on a percentage of total sales price.

For example, comparable 1 is located on a major thoroughfare, while the subject property is on a quiet residential street. So the adjustment value computed earlier for location can be assigned to comparable 1 and entered in the location box for that comparable. Keep in mind that selling prices of compa- rable properties are adjusted to reflect the probable market value of the subject property. Because the subject property\u2019s location is gener- ally considered a more desirable one than that of comparable 1, the adjustment value of $22,000 computed earlier must be added to the sales price of the comparable to find what the subject property would be worth.

In addition, it is easily understood by nonappraisers a preferred by the courts. Relying on past sales information, it gives th appearance of being the most logical and the most objective of th three approaches to forming an opinion of value. If reliable marke data can be found and such information can be related to the sub property, the approach has considerable validity. \u2018\n\nThe principal limitation of the sales comparison approach is th problem of insufficient comparable sales or, even worse, a situation which no comparable sales exist. If the subject is unique, or if the are no comparable sales available, then the approach cannot be use\n\nAnother difficulty is the need for making accurate adjustmen because two properties are seldom identical. Adjustments cannot based on subjective (what the appraiser \u201cfeels\u201d is right) evaluations the differences between properties or locations. Even under the b of circumstances, differences in value due to variations among prop: ties may be difficult to measure. Beyond this, it also may be difficul determine whether a particular transaction was a genuine arm\u2019s-len; transaction or whether peculiar circumstances affected the trans tion. \u2018",

The appraiser must always question the reli- ability of sales data in light of economic, political, and social marke! pressures.\n\nIn addition to its wide use in the appraisal of homes, the sales co parison approach is the preferred method for the appraisal of vac land, as discussed in Chapter 9. :\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe sales comparison approach relies on the collection of accurd data on both the general market and recent sales of specific propert comparable to the subject property.\n\nThe appraiser adjusts the sales price of a comparable property reflect any differences between it and the property that is the subj\u00e9 of the appraisal. Either a dollar adjustment or a perceniage adjus ment can be made. The value of an adjustment can be computed usi matched pairs analysis, also called paired sales analysis and pair data set analysis.

    "text": "# THE INCOME-BASED APPROACHES TO APPRAISAL\n\nIncome Capitalization and the Principle of Anticipation\n\nThe income capitalization approach is based on the premise that there is a relationship between the income a property can earn and the property\u2019s value. Income capitalization thus is a process of con- verting income into value, and the concept of anticipation is funda- mental to the approach. The principle of anticipation asserts that value is created by the expectation of benefits to be derived in the future. The price a buyer should be willing to pay for a property, therefore, would be equal to the present worth of these future ben-",

The discount recognizes the fact that an anticipated future dollar is worth less than a dollar in hand. For example, when you deposit $100 in a savings account to earn 3 percent annual interest, you are accept- ing the fact that the $103 you will receive at the end of the first year has a present value of only $100. Thus, $100 is the present value of $103 when discounted for one year at 3 percent. As you will see in Chapter 14, yield capitalization uses discount rates to find the present value of projected future income.\n\n:\n\n.\n\n\u2018\n\nMany commercial properties are purchased to be leased to other parties. The future net income the property is capable of earning and the eventual return (residual) of the investment capital are the main benefits to the owner. For this reason, the worth of the property to a prospective buyer is based largely on its earning capacity. The income capitalization approach to value translates the estimated potential income of a property into a determination of market value by the use of certain data and one of numerous income models that link different income variables to value.",

Historical rent information can serve as a check on the validity of current sched- uled rent data. Past periodic rent increases for the subject and similar properties may indicate to the appraiser whether the market appears to be following a trend, and whether current rent information is likely to be reliable. For instance, rents in a given area may be increasing at the rate of 8 percent annually. If the current scheduled rent of either the subject or any of the comparable properties is not in line with the trend, the appraiser should find the reason for the discrepancy to jus- tify the estimate of the rental value the property could command on the current market. Recent rental trends should, of course, be empha- sized in estimating the current market rental income for the appraised property.\n\nAgain, the appraiser can acquire the needed data for estimating\n\nmarket rental rates from the tenant, landlord, property management firms, real estate brokers in the area, or perhaps from the appraiser\u2019s own files.

A 75 percent occupancy level may be considered adequate for a hotel, even though the same occupancy level (representing a vacancy factor of 25 percent) may be considered poor for an office building.

The e basic components of the capitalization rate are the recapture rate an the interest rate, which will be discussed next. \u2018\n\nAs stated previously, an investor who purchases an income-pr ducing property expects two things:\n\n1. Return of the investment. This is the right to get back the pur- chase price at the end of the term of ownership and is ordinaril expressed as an annual rate.

This return is the investor\u2019s profit on the money used to purchase the property and is expressed as \" the interest rate. The interest rate is also referred to as the dis- count rate, risk rate, or return on rate.\n\nBecause land usually does not depreciate, its sales price at the en of the investor\u2019s period of ownership is considered adequate compet sation.

In processing income produced by land only, a recapture provision is usually unnecessary. The assumption (which does not necessarily reflect the reality of the marketplace) is that land will not depreciate, and recapture can therefore be accomplished entirely through resale. A building, however, does depreciate. That is, its value decreases with the passing of time.

Then th appraiser must consider the factors unique to the subject proper such as its age, its condition, and the area in which it is located.\n\nA building most frequently becomes useless through external ot functional obsolescence, rather than through physical deterioratio : that is, more buildings are torn down in still-usable condition than fall down from deterioration.

This method thus takes into account everyone who has a financial interest in the real estate being appraised. Not every inves- tor will be satisfied with the same rate of return on an investment. For example, the owner may regard his or her position as riskier than that of the first or second mortgage holders. Each mortgage creates a lien on the property. If the owner defaults, the property may be sold to pay such liens, and the owner will receive only those proceeds that may remain from the sale of the property after the lienholders have been paid. Because the owner\u2019s interest is generally considered inferior to those of lienholders, the owner may require a higher total return on the investment but accept a lower cash flow return, given the value of the owner\u2019s residual interest in the property in addition to the owner\u2019s subordinated claim on the cash flow.",

What is your est mate of value for the subject property?\n\nCheck your answer against the one in the Answer Key at the back of the book,\n\nB! YIELD CAPITALIZATION\n\n\u201c\n\nIn the process called yield capitalization, real estate investment return is broken down into two components: (1) an income flow for a specified number of years and (2) a capital change (a gain or loss) realized at the end of the multiyear investment period from an actual or assumed sale of the property. Yield capitalization is computed on cash accounting basis from the investor\u2019s perspective.\n\nYield capitalization is an appropriate technique to use for the investor who intends to buy an income-producing property and wants to know the value of the income stream that can be expected in the future from the property. An investor planning to obtain a mortgage loan to help pay for the property will also want to know how the mort- gage payments will affect the property\u2019s expected cash flow.\n\nThe tables discussed in this chapter can be used to make such cal- culations, but only after.the appraiser has made a thorough analysis: the subject property and the degrec of risk it carries as an investment. The relative permanence of the investment is considered; that is, the length of the lease term coupled with the reliability of the tenant. The capitalization method chosen by the appraiser depends on the pote! tial stability of the income stream. Generally, the tables included he and rehable",

Sometimes a dollar is worth less than a dollar. An investor may be interested in an investment that pays back x number of dollars at a certain time in the future, based on an initial investment that is some amount less than x dollars.

Such tables are available for other investment periods and interest rates and may even reflect interest computed on a monthly, quarterly, or semiannual basis. An annuity table allows an appraiser to match the projected length of the investment with the interest rate it is expected to produce, to find the factor to be multiplied by the desired level of yearly income.\n\nAn investor wishes to receive an annual income of $6,000 for four years by . . . making an investment earning 10 percent. What should be the amount of the original investment?\n\nColumn 1 in Figure 14.2 indicates that the annuity factor for an interest\n\nrate of 10 percent over an investment period of four years is 3.170. Multi- plied by the annual income sought ($6,000 x 3.170), an initial investment figure of $19,020 is derived. In other words, a $19,020 investment for four years at 10 percent interest will yield yearly income of $6,000. At the end of the four years, the entire amount invested, plus all interest earned, will have been returned to the investor.",

The retail store on the land is being leased by a major supermarket chain, which has been financially successful for 20 years and should remain so. The lease, as of the date of appraisal, will run for another 23 years. The yield rate on land and building has been calculated at 13 percent. The prop- erty provides an annual net operating income (NOI) of $36,000. What s its current market value?\n\nThe interest on the land value of $100,000 is $13,000 ($100,000 x 13%). When $13,000 is subtracted from the total annual NOI of $36,000, a net income residual of $23,000 ($36,000 - $13,000) may be used to derive the building value. Using the annuity table (Figure 14.2), it is determined that a 13 percent interest rate over 23 years provides a factor of 7.230.

Annuity tables do not assume a static (unchanging from year to year) recapture rate. Slow changes in building value are assumed in the early years of the invest- . . ment term, with greater changes in the last years of the investment. In the straight-line method of recapture, however, the same recapture rate is assumed for each year of the investment. The computations in Figure 14.4 show the difference in value that can result after a 25-year investment term at a 13 percent yield, using the straight-line method of recapture and the annuity table. The subject property is the one used in the preceding example.\n\n.\n\nThe land value of $100,000 in both methods is the same because the sales comparison approach was used. Building value differs, how- ever, because the annuity method allows for a slower decrease in building value over the early years of the building\u2019s life, providing . . . . higher value in later years. The' straight-line method, on the \u2019other hand, applies an equal decre?se' in value to be recaptured for every of the building\u2019s economic life.",

Martin (Chicago: Dearborn Real Estate Education, 2005)].\n\nCapitalization is the relationship between income and market value. Generally speaking, income capitalization is the most important approach used in valuing income-producing property and is the one appraisers normally rely on most heavily in the final value conclu- sion. The reliability of this approach is directly related to the quality of the data used and the proper application of income capitalization techniques.\n\nThe two ways of capitalizing income are direct capitalization and yield capitalization. Direct capitalization is the simplest mathematical process to apply, and when the rate used is supported adequately comparable sales in the market, it is 2 most convincing method for \u00e9stimating value.",

A capitalization rate can also be developed by breaking down the rate\u2019s component parts and estimat- ing each separately. The rate developed will be composed of recapture rate (return of investment) and inferest rate (return on investment). The recapture rate is often derived by using the straight-line metbod. The interest rate is developed by using the market extraction method.\n\nThe band of investment method takes into account both the rate required by the lender (called the mortgage constant) and the rate necessary for the equity investor\u2019s desired pretax cash flow (called the equity capitalization rate). An investment with a high degree of risk will have a corresponding high capitalization rate, resulting in a low property value. A low-risk investment will have a corresponding low capitalization rate and high value.",

Weighing the Choices\n\nOnce the appraiser is assured of the validity of the indicated values, he or she then must decide which is the most reliable, in terms of the value sought, for the subject property. Inherent factors may make particular method automatically more significant for certain kinds of property (such as the income approach for investment properties or the cost approach for special purpose properties). But other fac- tors, of which the appraiser should be aware, may negate part of that significance. An economically depressed neighborhood, for instance, may make any structure virtually worthless. If the appraiser is trying to determine market value, and if the market for property in a cer- tain neighborhood is likely to be extremely small, this fact should be reflected in the appraiser\u2019s final opinion of value.",

Because all comparable sales used in the analysis require few adjustments, considerable weight is given to the sales compari- son approach, as normally would be expected.

The cost approach tends to set an upper limit of value when the property is new, without functional or external obsolescence, and at its highest and best use. The older a struc- ture becomes, however, the more difficult it is to accurately estimate the proper amount of accrued depreciation. The fact that the subject house is. only a few years old strengthens the $431,500 opinion of value by the cost approach. ~\n\nFinally, the appraiser considers the market value derived from the income approach.

That is, in a narrative appraisal report, the appraiser summarizes the important background research and presents all the relevant data for each appraisal method that con- tributed to the final conclusion of value. A number of exhibits may be included, such as photographs of the subject property and its com- parables and maps showing demographic, topographical, soil, and other analyses of the subject and its comparables.

    "text": "TYPES OF PARTIAL INTERESTS\n\nThus far we have referr\u00e9d to real estate (land and improvements) owned outright\u2014what is termed fee simple ownership. You also should be familiar with other forms of property ownership, some of which have come into use in the United States fairly recently. Partial inter- ests include any interest that is less than full fee simple ownership o the entire property conveyed.\n\nCondominiums\n\nThe condominium form of ownership, long popular in Europe, has been used widely in this country only since the early 1960s. The owner of a typical condominium unit owns exclusive right to the airspace that encompasses that unit, as well as an interest in the common areas. Common areas typically include the land, courtyard walkways, parking spaces, foundation, outside walls, roof, lobby, hallways, elevators, and stairways, as well as recreational facilities such as swimming pools, golf courses, and tennis courts (see Fig ure 16.1). Unit owners must pay a proportional share of the mainte nance and upkeep expenses of the common areas. Many residential apartments, townhouses, offices, and retail stores now are held in the condominium form of legal ownership.",

The appraiser should note the condominium and/or management association that cares for common areas, the amount of monthly fees or other assess- ments charged, and any special facilities provided (such as a tennis\n\ncourt or swimming pool).\n\nAppraisers generally use the sales comparison approach to value individual condominium units. In areas of high population density, well-designed and well-maintained residential condominiums have appreciated in value, though typically not as much as detached homes, if those are available. If a surfeit of building has resulted in more condominiums than the available demand has warranted, prices will decrease to reflect the reduced demand. When a substantial number of condominium units are owned for rental investment purposes, main- tenance may be more difficult, particularly if absentee landlords are slow in paying homeowner assessments. Investors contributed to the run-up of property prices in many areas, particularly in Florida.",

A time-share purchaser receives the right to excluswe use of a portion of the property for a particular period of time each year (usually in units of one week) or a fractional or percentage share of ownership, frequently expressed as a number of points that can be traded for the use of a unit for a certain period of time. A time-sh\u00e9r'e'f, estate includes an estate (ownership) interest in the property; a tlme-f share use does not. :\n\nA time-share is best valued by the sales comparison approach. Initial sales\n\nprices are set by the developer based on amenities of the unit (size, special features, view) and the time of year involved. At a ski resort, for instance, a week in January is more valuable than a week in May. Holiday periods typi- cally have the highest premium. If percentage shares are sold, the minimum share available typically will purchase the right to use the smallest unit for \u2018the minimum time, usually at least one week.\n\nFor some time-share projects, high initial marketing costs and lim- ited resale potential have resulted in heavily discounted resale prices.

But some leases provide for payments to the lessee by the lessor for any improvements made by the lessee that will ultimately revert to the lessor.\n\nIn valuing lease interests, the appraiser must first carefully stud: the detailed provisions of the lease to determine the rights and obliga- tions of the owner \u2019fmd te.nant. Then, the valuation of leased fee and. leasehold interests is basically a matter of dividing the value of the. property into separate values attributable to each of the various inter- ests.

A condominium is the undivided ownership of the airspace that a unit actually occupies, plus an undivided interest in the ownership of the common elements, which are owned jointly with the other condominium unit owners. A planned unit development (PUD) includes individual ownership of a detached home and lot, town home and lot, or condominium, along with shared ownership of common areas. A time-share divides ownership into increments of time or a per- centage interest. Manufactured homes require special consideration of their location.\n\nProperty under co-ownership may be difficult to sell, and its value will be affected commensurately if all owners do not take part in the transaction.",

If there is a sublessee who also has an interest (which may occur when scheduled rent is less than market rent), the sublessee\u2019s interest\u2014the subleasehold\u2014will have risk characteristics similar to a second mortgage. Thus, the capitalization of either the prime lessee\u2019s interest or the sublessee\u2019s interest normally will warrant a higher capi- talization rate than that of the lessor\u2019s interest.\n\nThe sum of the values of the various lease interests tends to equal the value of the property under free and clear ownership. However, the scheduled rent paid by a reliable lessee exceeds the market rent, the sum of the values of the various interests could exceed the value of the real estate free and clear.",

Data on comparative properties indicate that the market rent of the subject property is $45,000 per year.\n\nThe lessor is virtually assured of receiving the rent, as long as it remains below market rent. In the opinion of the appraiser, an appropriate rate of interest for a low-risk investment of this type is 11 percent. The lessee, on the other hand, has an interest that is subject to variation in value. If market conditions change and the per-year rental value is no longer a favorable one, the value of the leasehold estate will be reduced considerably or even eliminated. To reflect the lessee\u2019s risk, the appraiser estimates the leasehold rate at 14 percent. The annuity factor for 30 at 14 percent is 7.003.",
