It covers the most relevant aspects of neurorehabilitation approaches as currently applied, most of which are dependent, to a large degree, upon advances made through basic, clinical, thera- peutic, social, and technological research during recent decades. We asked the authors-all of whom are acknowledged experts in a specific field of neurorehabilitation-to present their chapters with the current state of the art in their area and, as far as possible, the scientific basis on which contemporary treatment approaches are based. The authors were also asked to make their chapters attractive and accessible for both specialists and non-specialists involved in the neurorehabilitation of patients by including vid- eos, illustrations, and tables to provide a summary of particular aspects of their subject. Where appropriate, different perspectives on a given field are also provided. This volume should serve as a current overview covering all aspects of neurorehabilitation for medical doctors, scientists and therapists working in this diverse and advancing field.",

    "text": "Impressive progress has been made in the field of neuroreha- bilitation over recent decades. This period of change dawned with an almost exclusively experience-based neurorehabilitation approach, inaugurated by a number of schools and usually prac- ticed in separation from other medical disciplines. Over time, in most subspecialities, evidence-based neurorehabilitation has been gradually established. This move towards a more scientific and integrated paradigm is illustrated by smoother transitions from acute care: for instance, stroke patients into early rehabilita- tion requiring close multidisciplinary interactions characterized by close cooperation between clinical staff and researchers. This early phase of rehabilitation is followed by longer-term functional training approaches and social integration programmes, which are today being successfully applied for patients with stroke, brain injury, and spinal cord injury (SCI). Such modern rehabilitation approaches have strong theoretical underpinnings, for instance on evidence gained from animal experiments investigating the exploitation potential of neuroplasticity or from well-conducted patient studies concerning the effect of longer training times on the recovery of sensorimotor function during rehabilitation in patient with various forms of central (CNS) and peripheral nervous system damage. However, despite all this recent pro- gress, we must acknowledge the evident limitations of our treat- ment approaches. After severe CNS damage neurological deficits",

This has been associated with an increase in the use and impact of tech- nology in contemporary neurorehabilitation programmes, using assistive devices, feedback information, and virtual reality train- ing conditions. This technology allows standardized training ses- sions and objective measurement of the trajectory of movement recovery and can motivate the patient through feedback over the course of rehabilitation. Today, the significance of this technol- ogy is occasionally considered to be overestimated and its further development is critically discussed. Further progress with tech- nology must be driven by recognition of the physiological require- ments for its beneficial application. Nevertheless, there are few doubts that technology will continue to have an increasing impact in neurorehabilitation.",

    "text": "Despite all these promising developments, in several respects there are still hurdles to overcome if we are to achieve optimal neurorehabilitation strategies. Although concepts such as neuro- plasticity are well attested in animal experiments, a major prob- lem still concerns the successful translation of basic research into clinical applications. Several causes may perpetuate this problem. Despite promising techniques for inducing neural regeneration in animal models, applying therapies based on these concepts in human patients with SCI has not yet shown convincing results. This failure may be due to the lack of an adequate animal model and a solution will require close cooperation between researchers and clinicians involved in the care of patients with CNS damage. We are also still at the beginning of building a true understand- ing of the factors which underlie and influence training effects. For example, which proprioceptive input is required to achieve meaningful limb muscle activation, in turn leading to training effects resulting in improved sensorimotor functional outcomes? How can a treatment programme be optimally adapted to indi- vidual abilities and requirements, for example, with respect to movement velocity and complexity? To what extent must training of particular factors, such as equilibrium control during stepping, be challenging?",

One such solution might be improved transition from an initial, short, focused neurorehabilitation period in specialized centres, prior to early integration into community- or home-based rehabilita- tion with community-based nursing care and an environment adapted to the individual's needs and access to neurorehabilita- tion specialists.\n\nObservations indicate that neuroplasticity can still be success- fully exploited in elderly patients and lead to a degree of neurolog- ical recovery similar to that possible in young patients, although translation in functional gains is usually poor. Elderly people thus require special training approaches focused on a few important daily life activities, something often more successfully achieved in a familiar setting (i.e. at home or in the community) rather than in a specialized centre where elderly people may have difficulty adapting to an unfamiliar setting.",

It lists body functions and structure, and activity and participation. The relationship between impairment, activity, and participation is not linear, and can be further moderated by contextual factors, including personal and environmental fac- tors. Each of these components is denoted by a prefix, followed by a numeric code, and then a qualifier, which also has a numeric value. This approach allows clear description of each domain, the extent of any impairment, and the level of performance and capacity at the activity and participation level. There are a wide range of potential applications of the ICF. It has been adopted most widely within rehabilitation services to describe individual functioning, but can also be used at a service and national policy level to describe, monitor, and evaluate different activities. This chapter aims to outline the use of the ICF, consider its strengths, and highlight its function in a range of settings.",

For many years there was a tension between medical and social models of disability. In the medical model disability was seen as a problem of the individual\u2019s body, whereas the social model identified dis- ability as a consequence of the external environment and soci- etal attitudes [2]. These two views polarize the debate. While it is clearly not acceptable for an individual to be denied their role in society through barriers created by the social, political and physi- cal environment, it is also appropriate for clinicians, if requested, to treat pain, spasticity, weakness and other symptoms.",

It lists body functions and structure, and activity and participation [1] . Functioning refers to all body functions, activities, and participation, while disability is used for impairments, activity limitations, and participation restrictions. The relationship between impairment, activity, and participation is not linear, and can be further moderated by con- textual factors, including personal and environmental factors. Body structures and functions, activities, participations, and environmental factors are coded, whereas personal factors are not. For example, the loss of a little finger is an impairment of body structure; in most people this will result in little change in activity or participation, but for an international concert vio- linist the participation restriction will be considerable and will impact on their ability to maintain paid work. However, whether they are able to accept this participation restriction and go on to find other paid work, say as a cab driver, will depend on personal factors including values and beliefs about paid work, and envi- ronmental factors such as their families willingness to support them financially.",

Reasons highlighted were that activities and participation were categorized together in comparison with the very distinct conceptual differences of dis- ability and handicap found in the earlier ICIDH. It was reported that, as they were conceptually distinct, they should have been categorized separately. However, it was recognized that users could differentiate activity and participation domains in a num- ber of different ways, and this was left up to the user. Many users used to describing disability in terms of loss found the more positive language of the ICF unwieldy. It was felt that the ICF could only be used effectively following training. However, by 2012, Wiegand and colleagues [5] felt that although the adop- tion of the ICF was widespread in the field of rehabilitation, its implementation in practice was idiosyncratic and had rarely been evaluated properly. A study in 2013 of the implementation of the ICF in Israeli rehabilitation centres among physiotherapists sug- gested that the majority were familiar with the ICF, and nearly two thirds reported partial implementation in their units [6]. Implementation focused mostly on adopting the biopsychosocial concepts and using ICF terms. The ICF was not used either for evaluating patients or for reporting or encoding patient informa- tion, supporting Wiegand\u2019s view that evidence that the ICF has lead to real changes is lacking [5].",

Madden and colleagues [15] recently investigated the relationship between the ICF and information in reports published to monitor and evaluate com- munity rehabilitation services. Thirty-six articles were selected for analysis containing 2495 information items. Approximately one third of the 2,495 information items identified in these arti- cles (788 or 32%) related to concepts of functioning, disability and environment, and could be coded to the ICF. These information items were spread across the entire ICF classification with a con- centration on activities and participation (49% of the 788 infor- mation items) and environmental factors (42%). Based on these findings Madden and colleagues [15] suggest the ICF can be used as a potentially useful framework and classification, providing building blocks for the systematic recording of information related to functioning and disability to inform health professionals and other staff, and to enable national and international comparisons. The ICF could also be used to guide social policy development, including legislative reviews, model legislation, regulations and guidelines, and definitions for anti-discrimination legislation. For example, at the social level the ICF has potential to be used for eligibility criteria for state entitlements such as social security benefits, disability pensions, workers\u2019 compensation, and insur- ance.

They suggest the ICF could serve as a reference for describing work capacity, provided the ICF contains all necessary categories. It is of interest that as well as recording the ICF categories the authors recognize the need for a socio-medical history, and a determination of the feasibility and effectiveness of intervention and the prognosis.

In research, the ICF has been used to provide a framework for patient-reported outcomes. Baker et al. described a scale selec- tion strategy for choosing relevant outcomes for a study of robot- ics to treat the upper limb after stroke [20]. They used the ideas contained in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Patient Reported Outcome Measures document and mapped them on to the ICF to select a comprehensive set of measures.

He states that education of those in occupational medicine, work rehabilita- tion, disability adjudication, policy and legislation, and govern- ment agencies about the ICF will lead to greater implementation of the ICF, including determining functional and work capacity and as a reference framework and a language of disability to help facilitate a common ground of understanding.",

Work is currently being undertaken to address these difficulties [25]. However, our understanding of impairment of structure and function continues to develop and can now be considered at molecular, subcellular, cellular, and tissue level. Any categorization of pathology is likely to run the risk of being either simplistic or complex, incomplete and unwieldy. However, within the rehabilitation framework identifying pathology and its treat- ment is essential to allow rehabilitation physicians and teams to use all the means at their disposal to minimize disability. As rec- ognized by the original authorsof the ICF, in addition to failing to recognize pathology, it fails to acknowledge as part of the patho- logical diagnosis the importance of disease course in managing the treatment of disability; the needs of a person with relapsing remitting MS are quite different than the needs of a patient with a progressive neuropathy, which differ again from someone with a single-incident disorder.

If rehabilitation is concerned with changing behaviour in an adap- tive manner, then working with patients to determine their goals demands more than an understanding of the activity limitations and participation restrictions, but also needs an understanding of values and beliefs that lead to the prioritization of one goal over another.\n\nIn summary, the ICF represents a significant step forward and has embedded a biospsychosocial approach into rehabilitation thinking. It is used as a framework for considering the disabil- ity experienced by individual patients. However, it has not been adopted as widely as envisaged. It has rarely used for evaluat- ing patients, or for reporting or encoding patient information, or for the evaluation of treatment and other interventions. It has potential to be used far more widely, including in education of both professionals and patients, to be used within occupational medicine, vocational rehabilitation, and government policy, allowing a shared language and precise coding of information both within and between services and countries. Some of the reasons for its slow adoption may be that it can feel unwieldy. It is likely that with the increasing use of core sets that the ICF will be used more widely in the future. Other limitations, many of which were highlighted by the authors at outset, include the fact that it does not incorporate any model of illness, or provide descriptors of personal factors, and individual values and beliefs. There is, however, a growing consensus about the use of the ICF and how it should further develop. With time, it is likely to be adopted more widely.",

Rehabilitation services provide this help. Rehabilitation is a process focused on disabil- ity, the functional activities that are limited. It aims to optimize participation in social activities and to minimize distress and discomfort. Neurological and neuromuscular diseases are a com- mon and potent cause of persistent, often progressive disability. Therefore the process of neurological rehabilitation is important to all healthcare.",

The primary difference is that the focus of atten- tion in rehabilitation is on disability, the functional activities that are limited, rather than on the underlying damage to or disease of the nervous system, which is the focus of neurological and neuro- surgical services.",

In the paper he drew upon sociological and other research to formalise a much broader approach to analys- ing and understanding illness. Together with the ideas of Talcott Parsons published in 1952 [6], the biopsychosocial model of ill- ness enabled a fuller understanding of illness. The biopsychosocial model was soon used by the World Health Organization as the basis for the International Classification of Impairments, Disabilities and Handicaps (WHO ICIDH, 1980) [7] and then the improved International Classification of Functioning (WHO ICF, 2001) [8].",

Indeed most people now equate brain damage with a change in their personhood\u2014who they are.\n\nThere are few if any conditions that affect the central nervous system that do not cause complex problems.

The problems for one patient requires the attention of a few to many people delivered over a variable length of time often in a variety of settings. These people constitute that person\u2019s team. Other patients will have other prob- lems, some in common and some not. Some of the people involved will help many patients, some only a proportion. Nonetheless, the areas of expertise are similar.\n\nThe simplest solution is for there to be a group of people who between them can resolve the majority of problems faced by the majority of people with neurological disease. The evidence sug- gests, quite strongly, that this leads to a better outcome for the patient at no more cost to the healthcare system. The evidence also suggests that a system focused on the patient\u2019s needs and wishes whereby the group of people involved discuss and agree a set of goals which they work towards collaboratively is more effective.",

If we accept that rehabilitation is effec- tive [5] , can we justify the cost?\n\nAs most of the costs associated with living with a disability in the community are related to the cost of providing personal care (e.g. assistance with washing, dressing, toileting, and meal provi- sion), economic evaluations have focused on recording individu- al\u2019s daily and weekly care requirements and using this information to develop a cost model. Additional expenditure associated with expensive equipment or housing adaptations can be included in this model. Once costs are established for a healthcare economy, then the model can be applied to other patients coming through the system. Once such model is based on the suite of measures developed in Northwick Park Hospital in London, UK [7] , which capture the weekly care requirements of people with long-term neurological conditions and translate this into a weekly cost of care. Other models have been developed around the costs asso- ciated with a year-of-care, for example, motor neurone disease. But, for many people with a sudden onset neurological condition, improvement can be expected with rehabilitation and costs are loaded towards the initial year after onset [8].",

Furthermore, most of the potential savings are recouped through reduced social care costs and welfare payments, although health systems benefit through reduced length of stay and fewer second- ary complications for patients [10], and improved outcomes for family carers [11].

However, the limitations of this model were quickly identified as the impact of impairments are modulated by a wide range of factors both internal and external to the individual. So, for example, a heavy goods vehicle driver who developed post-stroke epilepsy would be unable to return to driving as an occupation for up to 10 years, even if he had no other physical manifestations of the his stroke. This is a function of a country\u2019s legislation in relation to driver licensing, which would be considered an issue relating to the person\u2019s environment in the widest sense.

For example, attempts have been made to link the Barthel Index with the EuroQol as there is a commonality in some of the items (mobility, personal care, usual activities). However, the items of the two measures are worded and scored differently, which would result in different responses to the items. More importantly, the Barthel Index is clinician-scored and the EuroQol is self-report, therefore two different and not nec- essarily equivalent perspectives are recorded [22]. Furthermore, 40% of the items (pain and psychological functioning) in the EuroQol have no correspondence with items on the Barthel Index. This leaves a large, clinically important, component of the QALY unscored, which may result in a floor effect where a potentially important clinical difference is not recorded by the measure [23]. This illustrates a use of the ICF in choosing a suitable measure. Each component of the ICF can be measured (the Barthel Index measures body functions and activity) but this does not directly relate to other components of the ICF. Therefore, to measure participation, one needs to choose a scale that relates directly to the construct that it is intended to measure. This avoids the con- ceptual discrepancy between collecting data that are expected to change with the proposed rehabilitation intervention and a meas- ure that does not identify that a change has occurred. Examples of measures and how they relate to the ICF constructs are given in Figure 3.2.",

Money and time are interval-level data and are crucial to calculating the full economic cost of an intervention. However, many health status measures produce, at best, ordinal- level data, which cannot be manipulated arithmetically or corre- lated to interval-level data, rendering most economic analyses of this type invalid. As an example, one might examine the stairs item of the Barthel index, which records patients\u2019 stair climbing abilities into one of three categories: unable (0), needs help (aid, verbal, physical; 1), and independent (2). Independence in stair climbing can make a huge difference to a person\u2019s independence when they return home and a great deal of time and rehabilita- tion staff effort (money) goes into achieving this. Yet, the record- ing of change by the Barthel Index item (output) will not correlate directly with the input: the effort of generating stair climbing ability at all is very substantial compared to gaining independent stair climbing once this has been achieved [26]. Therefore gaining a Barthel point from 0 to 1 takes far greater resource (and cost) than from 1 to 2, yet would appear to generate the same improve- ment in the overall Barthel score (a change of 1 point). A better measure for this purpose would be the Assessment of Motor and Process Skills (AMPS), which is based on analyses that produce an interval-level score [27].",

Discharge destination was not determined by the dependency level, but environmental factors: 93% of patients were discharged home if they lived with a carer and had their own accommodation. Median length of stay was 29 days (interquartile range 32 days). However, only 22% of patients who did not have their own accommodation or live with a carer returned home (length of stay 62 days; IQR 51), illus- trating the importance of these factors in promoting a safe and timely discharge relative to the underlying diagnosis or the resultant impairments.",

Rehabilitation ser- vices have always had to respond to wider social and political demands. The two greatest changes to the delivery of rehabilita- tion in developed countries was the impact of the First and Second World Wars. These catastrophes resulted in the development and expansion of amputee rehabilitation services and neurologi- cal rehabilitation services, respectively [38, 39]. Other changes have been more evolutionary rather than revolutionary and have responded to changes in epidemiology [40], technology [41], and service delivery [3] . Cultural changes have also determined that rehabilitation and disability management services are delivered more in the community rather than in institutions [42]. Most of these developments and changes have been positive, resulting in enhanced services and better outcomes for those affected by disabling conditions. More recently, however, global economic pressures have resulted in a contraction of health and social care services, or at least a halt to further investment in new services. Straitened healthcare budgets over the last decade have resulted in a failure to appreciate the benefits of investment-to-save with its upfront budgetary requirements.",

    "text": "Why should we predict activities after stroke? Stroke recovery is heterogeneous in terms of outcome, and it is estimated that 25 into 25% of the 50 million stroke survivors worldwide require some assistance or are fully dependent on car- egivers for activities of daily living (ADL) after their stroke [1] . In addition to medical management after acute stroke to prevent further cerebral damage, early stroke rehabilitation is initiated with the ultimate goal of achieving better recovery in terms of body functions and activities in the first months after stroke, and to reduce disability and handicap during the years that follow [2]. Knowledge about factors that determine the final outcome in terms of activities after stroke is important for early stroke man- agement, in order to set suitable rehabilitation goals, enable early discharge planning, and correctly inform patients and relatives. The current trend to shorten the length of stay in hospital stroke units, as well as the increasing demand for efficiency in the conti- nuity of stroke care, imply that knowledge about the prognosis for the outcome in terms of basic activities such as dressing, mobility, and bathing is crucial to optimize stroke management in the first months post stroke. Knowledge about the prognosis in terms of activities (i.e. functional prognosis) is also important for the effec- tive design of future trials in stroke rehabilitation. In particular, identifying subgroups of patients who may benefit most from a particular intervention [3\u20135] and stratifying patients into prog- nostically comparable groups will prevent underpowered stud- ies (i.e. type II errors), keeping in mind that the contribution of stroke rehabilitation services is relatively small",

A number of observational stud- ies suggest that the degree of recovery in terms of impairments and activities after stroke is already largely defined within the first days after stroke onset [9\u201316]. This finding also suggests that the effectiveness of therapy is not only determined by selecting the most effective therapy but also depends on selecting appropri- ate patients, who show some potential for recovery of activities after stroke. Moreover, many evidence-based therapies such as constraint-induced movement therapy (CIMT) or modified ver- sions of it, body weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT), neuromuscular stimulation, and early supported discharge poli- cies by a stroke team are heavily dependent on an appropriate selection of stroke patients [17]. Hence, the establishment of an adequate prognosis by a stroke rehabilitation team will increase the efficiency of stroke services and reduce costs. From a patient\u2019s perspective, effective prognostics enable health care professionals",

Furthermore, a number of previous systematic reviews of prog- nostic research have shown that a high proportion of prognostic studies in stroke are of poor methodological quality [18\u201321]. On the other hand, a favourable trend can be discerned, since the bet- ter quality studies were published in the most recent years [18, 20].

The development over time of body functions (i.e. impairments) and activities (i.e. disabilities) after stroke is characterized by a large diversity. Some patients show hardly any improvement even in the long term, whereas other patients recover fully within hours or days after their stroke. Even though the outcome of stroke patients is heterogeneous and individual recovery patterns differ, clear mathematical regularities (i.e. logistic and sigmoidal) have been found in these non-linear patterns of recovery, making the outcome in terms of body functions and activities highly predict- able [7, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 27\u201331]. Figure 4.1 shows an average com- mon, hypothetical pattern of stroke recovery of patients with a first-ever ischaemic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke [32].",

The so-called Guttmann scaling procedure yielded a coefficient of scalability ranging from 0.72 for week 26 to 0.85 for week 3 post stroke, suggesting that about 80% of the patients progressed through this fixed sequence in time.

In a previous prospective study in 75 first-ever MCA stroke survivors, we found that age and the initial BI score measured at day 5 post stroke predicted 84% of the AUC for the outcome in terms of ADL independency 1 year post stroke. In this study, patients were classified as ADL-independent if they had a BI score of 19 or 20 points. However, adding magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings at 11 days post stroke, such as the presence of white matter lesions, hemisphere of stroke, cortical or subcorti- cal, and lesion and stroke volume, increased the AUC from 0.84 to 0.87 in the surviving patients. [54] In line with other studies in this field that investigated the impact of stroke lesion volumes on the outcome in terms of ADL [55], this prospective cohort study sug- gests that neuroimaging variables from conventional MRI scans do not increase the accuracy of long-term prediction of ADL [54-56].",

    "text": "In addition to the predictive validity of neurological scales such as NIHSS and CNS, a number of prospective cohort studies have shown that the baseline value of the BI (or FIM) assessed within 2 weeks post stroke is highly associated with the final BI (or FIM) measured at 6 months post stroke [7, 27, 53, 54]. However, the predic- tive accuracy of the initial BI score seems to be time dependent [53]. For example, a prospective cohort study investigating the diagnostic accuracy of the BI in 206 hemispheric stroke patients [53] showed a significantly higher accuracy in predicting the outcome in terms of the BI at 6 months when assessed at 5 or 9 days post stroke than when assessed at 2 days post stroke. The AUC ranged from 0.785 on day 2 to 0.837 and 0.848 on days 5 and 9, respectively, suggesting that the assessment on day 5 proved to be the earliest post-stroke moment for an optimal prediction of final outcome in terms of ADL (Figure 4.4). This finding suggests that the BI should preferably be measured at the end of the first week in hospital-based stroke units to ensure effective stroke rehabilitation management. This time- dependence of the predictability can be explained by several puta- tive mechanisms. The first is that 2 days post stroke is too early for patients to begin to develop the compensatory strategies that they",

The second possibility is that subjects may have a greater tendency to perform below their true maximal capacity early after stroke. The third option is that oedema and metabolic factors, which have their maximal influence in the first 72 hours, could mask the capacity for recovery.\n\nThe less than optimal prediction of BI at 6 months for patients assessed within 72 hours in our study may have been caused by the instability of neurological deficits, which is manifested by the neu- rological worsening observed in approximately 25% of all patients during the first 24 to 48 hours after stroke [53]. However, a paral- lel study focusing on the timing of an assessment of neurological deficits by the NIHSS in the same population resulted in no signif- icant differences between days 2, 5, and 9 [15], which makes neu- rological worsening within this period unlikely. A more plausible explanation could be that observers find it difficult to determine the patient\u2019s actual performance in terms of basic ADL when the patient is still bedridden. As a consequence, an assessment within 72 h post stroke will underestimate their actual performance. In line with the recommendation by Kasner [57], our findings sug- gest that even in individuals with a minor stroke who are bedrid- den during the first few days after stroke, the BI will underestimate outcome scores, making the BI an unsuitable instrument to meas- ure disability within the first 3 days post stroke.",

Various prog- nostic studies suggest that age [60, 61], severity of sensory and motor dysfunction of the paretic leg [62], homonymous hemiano- pia [61. 62], urinary incontinence [11, 60], sitting balance [11, 13, 21, 63\u201366], initial disability in ADL and ambulation [10, 11, 13], level of consciousness on admission [60], and the number of days between stroke onset and first assessment [16] are independently associated with gait outcomes 6 months after stroke [21]. For example, the EPOS study, involving 154 first-ever ischaemic stroke patients who were unable to walk independently, used multivariate (or multivariable) logistic modelling to show that accurate predic- tion within 72 hours is achievable at hospital stroke units by means of two simple bedside tests: namely sitting balance and muscle strength of the paretic leg. Independent gait was defined as 4 points or more on the Functional Ambulation Categories (FAC), suggest- ing that patients could be classified as safe walkers able to walk independently on flat surfaces [21]. Those non-ambulatory patients who regained their sitting balance as assessed by the trunk control test (TCT) and who developed some voluntary movement of the hip, knee and/or ankle as assessed by the MI\u2013leg score (\u226525 points) within the first 72 hours post stroke had about a 98% chance of regaining independent gait within 6 months.

Comparing these findings with those of other studies is difficult due to the lack of prognostic studies investigating the accuracy of prediction within 72 hours. However, a number of prospective studies have shown that muscle strength of the hemiplegic leg [21, 61, 62] and sitting balance [11, 21, 64], when measured between the second to fourth week after stroke, are significantly associated with improvement of walking ability [13] and achieving independent gait [13, 65, 66] at 6 months. Obviously, the early control of sitting balance as a prerequisite for regaining standing balance and gait is an impor- tant factor for the final outcome at 6 months [65]. The importance of balance control for gait is also supported by the study of Kollen and colleagues [13], who showed that improvement in standing balance was the most important variable associated with improve- ment of gait performance as measured with the FAC [13].",

This finding is sup- ported by a number of recent longitudinal studies showing that gait recovery is closely related to learning to use compensatory movement strategies [67\u201369]. For instance, patients learn to keep their balance by shifting their centre of gravity to the non-paretic side [68, 70], despite significant change in motor control on the paretic side is almost lacking [67, 69]. In the same vein, longitudi- nal studies with repeated measurements over time show that the contribution of the non-paretic side to the increase in comforta- ble and maximal walking speed is larger than the contribution of the paretic side [71]. To date, all longitudinal studies suggest that patients learn to cope with existing neurological deficits when regaining standing balance [68, 70, 72] and independent gait",

The results showed that those patients with some finger extension and some visible shoul- der abduction on day 2 after stroke onset had a 98% probability of achieving some upper limb function at 6 months. In contrast, patients who did not show this voluntary motor control had a probability of only 25%. It was also remarkable that 60% of the patients with some finger extension within 72 hours had regained full upper limb function according to the ARAT at 6 months. [14] This finding confirms the substantial predictive value of finger extension as a positive sign for a favourable outcome for the upper paretic limb in the acute phase after stroke. Retesting the model on days 5 and 9 showed that the probability of regaining function remained 98% for those with some finger extension and shoulder abduction, whereas the probability decreased from 25% to 14% for those without this voluntary control. Obviously, the reservation of some voluntary finger extension reflects the importance of the presence of some intact corticospinal tract fibres of the corticospi- nal tract system (CST) in the affected hemisphere that can activate distal arm and hand muscles [82], assuming that the forearm and hand lack direct bilateral innervation from both hemispheres [84]. Studies using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) [83\u201385] and diffusion tensor imaging [86, 87] have further confirmed this hypothesis. For example, Van Kuijk et al.

This difference in the relevance of lesion volume in predicting impairment versus ADL was to be expected as the latter largely depends on compensation. The probability of regaining hand function declined from 54% when the corticofu- gal tract was only partly affected to 13% when both motor cortex and internal capsule were affected. The latter study once again shows that the return of hand function 1 year after stroke largely depends on the preservation of neuroanatomical areas known to represent the corticofugal tract of the upper limb. Obviously, the involvement of structures with a greater density of dysfunctional corticofugal tract fibres, such as the internal capsule, is associ- ated with poor recovery of hand motor function at one year post stroke [90].",

Recent kinematic analyses have shown that these improvements, such as in FM-scores, within the first eight post-stroke weeks parallel the restitution of quality of motor con- trol in terms of: (1) the number of degrees of freedom that patients are able to control for in a reaching task [96] and normalization of jerk during, for example, a reaching task [97]. Beyond these first weeks of restitution, often regarded as the period in which true neurological repair takes place, improvements are mainly charac- terized by substitution and learning to adapt to existing neurolog- ical deficits [98]. Furthermore, it has been shown that more severe impairments at stroke onset result in slower patterns of recovery then on average to 3 months post stroke for more severe affected subjects [33].",

In their study, this maximal potential motor recov- ery was defined as the difference between initial FM upper limb (FM-UL) measured within 72 hours post stroke and the maximal possible score of 66 points [16: p. 68]. According to this recovery model, patients with an initial severe upper limb impairment (i.e. a low initial FM-UL score) have more room to improve on the FM-UL, and thus have a larger potential for improvent when com- pared to patients with an initial mild upper limb impairment (i.e. a high initial FM-UL score). This fixed amount of spontaneous neu- rological change was observed particularly in those with a mild to moderate neurological deficit after a first ever hemispheric stroke, which was the case in the majority (~70%) of ischaemic stroke patients. The reason why patients with more severe initial neuro- logical deficits show less spontaneous neurological improvement remains unknown. One may hypothesize that the reversibility of impaired brain function due to ischemia is influenced by the size of the lesion, and underlying processes involving recovery of neu- ronal networks including mechanisms of homeostatic neuroplas- ticity in the first weeks post stroke [7, 77, 98\u2013100] Unfortunately, the study of Prabhakaran et al.

Among patients with baseline cognitive impairment, 36% were found to show improved cognitive function beyond the first 3 months after stroke [102]. These results are similar to those that Kotila and col- leagues reported [103], and Wade and coworkers found significant recovery in several aspects of memory between 3 and 6 months after stroke [76]. Recovery of constructional apraxia may be seen up to 6 months after stroke. However, it is important to distin- guish in these tests between improvements in body function and activities acknowledging that recovery of activities or abilities to perform a clinical test does not per se reflect true neurologi- cal repair but rather more optimal using compensation or coping strategies of the patient [99, 104].",

Determining which of these interventions results in the great- est possible functional improvement requires an evidence base derived from randomized controlled trials (RCT) conducted by investigators with an understanding of the best elements of trial design, implementation, and interpretation. Emerging consensus standards for clinical trials serve as a useful starting point for the investigator planning a clinical trial in neurorehabilitation. In this chapter, we use the recent SPIRIT guidelines [1] as a framework while progressing through the developmental stages of a clinical trial. We emphasize what is most unique about complex interven- tions to improve motor-related outcomes, since the great majority of RCT, over 500, have been devoted to motor rehabilitation after stroke [2].",

Design and preparation for a clinical trial, regardless of study size, should focus on who will participate, what intervention will be delivered, and how change in function will be measured.\n\nChoice of trial design When discussing clinical research, the \u2018gold standard\u2019 trial is considered to be a prospective, parallel-group superiority trial that compares a novel intervention to the standard of care in a selected group of participants. Other traditional trial designs such as crossover and factorial designs tend to be used less often in neurological rehabilitation due to concerns about carry-over effects or interactions between interventions, respectively. While the majority of the discussion in this chapter will focus on clas- sical RCT design, it should be emphasized that a RCT is the final step in an iterative preparatory process; alternate trial designs may more efficiently answer questions earlier in an intervention\u2019s development.",

In the basic n-of-1 design, measurements are taken to establish the functional baseline of a single person (A), after which an intervention is provided (B) and a re-evaluation (A) is performed to determine if changes in the outcome measure of interest have occurred. More complex permutations including multiple baselines, several repetitions of the AB structure rand- omized for order of presentation, and combinations of interven- tions can also be tested. Due to statistical concerns regarding bias in participant selection and the significance of effect size calcu- lated from small sample sizes, the results of these studies should be interpreted with caution; they may not generalize to the population of interest.

This strategy has been used successfully to assess medication dosing for safety and to get a sense of possible efficacy. Adaptive trial designs can arrive at answers faster than the standard designs in which efficacy is not determined until data have been collected from all study par- ticipants.

Impairment is defined\n\nas a problem with body structure or function, for example the inability to voluntarily move the arm after a stroke. Limitations in activity, for example buttoning a shirt, occur when a person encounters difficulty in executing a task. Participation in life situ- ations can be restricted due to individual limitations in activity or to a lack of accommodation for the disabled person.

Many persons with neurological disease are relatively inactive when compared to age-matched healthy con- trols [11] yet retain the latent capacity to rapidly improve when participating in the regular training that forms the key compo- nent of many neurorehabilitation interventions. A separate con- cern regarding the functional capacity of persons participating in rehabilitation trials is the relative frequency with which those who demonstrate mild-to-moderate functional impairments are recruited. Many extant interventions can lead to functional gains in people with mild residual impairment; fewer therapeutic strate- gies are tested in those suffering from moderate-to-severe loss of physical or cognitive functioning.",

Rodent studies may bear little relationship to the type and timing of injuries and interventions that occur in patients with neurological disease [47]. Behavioural measures in mammals are far less sophisticated and informative than those in humans. The process of rehabilitation involves the use of cues and feedback that have no correlate in animal training. Furthermore, genetic homogeneity and the loss of a natural living environment may alter the responsiveness of animals in ways that are not predictive of changes in function for disabled persons.",

To lessen the potential for this effect, one could obtain multiple measures over one month before or after entry, prior to the start of the trial, to look for a stable baseline (see Duncan et al. [17] for an example). An alternate method would be to provide a modest intervention to participants in all trial arms to ensure that each has reached a functional plateau prior to introducing the formal intervention [48]. Either method would be appropriate to remove some of the uncertainty associated with single measurements of function and ensure that any changes after an intervention are most likely a true response and not a clinical-statistical fluctuation [49].",

As will be discussed, getting to the milestone at which a demonstration of efficacy becomes worthwhile is an iterative process involving several stages of development prior to the RCT [58].\n\nProgression through trial stages The majority of clinical trials in medicine tend to follow the pat- tern established for pharmaceutical design and safety testing. Phase I involves a relatively high risk or novel intervention given to a small number of healthy or affected people. Establishing safety and examining responsiveness are the primary goals. Phase II follows Phase I and builds upon knowledge of risks. More par- ticipants are involved. Safety and potential efficacy are studied. The effects of different dosages of a medication or intensity of an intervention are determined, along with the best research meth- odology and outcome measures, in preparation for Phase III. Phase III rigorously assesses the potential for efficacy of the inter- vention by a randomized trial with blinded outcomes, comparing the new intervention to a standard one or to a placebo. The power for the study may be drawn from Phase II studies. Phase IV refers to the post-approval phase in which the intervention is approved for use in specified populations of people and provided as a part of routine care. Safety, including interactions with medications, is evaluated in the general population through drug registries and voluntary event reporting to monitoring agencies.",

To continue the aforementioned exam- ple, the same total change in upper extremity FM score can result from functional improvements at separate joints, for example the elbow and wrist versus the shoulder. A person would demonstrate improved reach and grasp ability in the former case but not in the latter despite similar overall improvement in the FM score. Failure to differentiate between the two methods of achieving the same change score could lead to highly different interpretations of an intervention\u2019s efficacy, which has the potential to affect the direc- tion of future research efforts. Investigators should also be aware that, for many multi-item ordinal scales, the transition from one rank to another is not linear and modern psychometric methods such as IRT or Rasch analysis may need to be applied to ensure scale reliability prior to statistical analysis [71].",

Distribution-based methods that make use of the effect size can also be used to calculate the MCID [74]. While the MCID provides an estimate of how much change is required to be clinically significant, investigators should be aware that its magnitude is dependent upon the population being tested and the method of calculation, amongst other factors, and that transla- tion of MCID to another clinical setting or population of different characteristics should be done with caution [41].",

    "text": "Introduction General aspects pertaining to age and ageing The worldwide ageing of the population described later in this section is associated with an expected increase in morbidity and demand for long-term care [1] . There are several important factors to consider regarding the ageing person. Increased age does not nec- essarily mean inability to work or to be physically fit. International retirement ages are being increased not lowered. Post-retirement people are very active, travel extensively, are politically involved, and believe in continuing personal development (e.g. the Gray Panthers www.graypanthers.org; they participate!). Thus, age should not be the main factor in deciding rehabilitation potential. Stroke is one of the most frequent neurological conditions and is strongly associated with age-related changes of the organism, in particular with the cardiovascular system and typically occurs in older persons. Age is an important, yet not modifiable, risk factor for stroke [2]. Accordingly hemiparesis due to stroke is typically seen in older patients. A marked increase of stroke cases in future decades are predicted based on a combination of estimates regard- ing the ageing of the population and observed incidence rates [3]. Another neurological condition requiring interdisciplinary neuro- logical rehabilitation is spinal cord injury (SCI). Typical causes for a SCI in young male patients were severe traumas sustained from vehicular or sport accidents. However, the mean age of patients with acquired traumatic SCI has increased in recent years [4]. Beside the traumatic SCI, non-traumatic causes have become more frequent. One of the characteristics of the latter group of patients is an older age compared to those",

The concept of growing old encompasses a vari- ety of additional aspects [6] .\n\nChronological age is commonly used to give a certain age. It refers to the elapsed time, starting from birth. This understanding of the ageing process is, for example, reflected in the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) where persons are categorized according to their age into different age groups: for example aged 65 through 79 years, or aged 80 and over. The description of a persons\u2019 age by using years is useful in numerous ways. However, it can be insufficient for some purposes. Two patients with the same chronological age can exhibit different age-related medical conditions which influence clinical decision making when choosing treatment options. Also for spe- cific research questions matching of an intervention and a control group purely based on chronological age might negatively influence the outcome. A definition of ageing or age-related characteristics, which goes beyond counting years must be adopted.",

In the USA, the average age at injury was 29 years in the 1970s and 41 years in the period 2005\u20132010 with 2% being 75 years or older [12, 13]. In Europe the corresponding age was 45 years in the latter period [14], (Wirz, unpublished).\n\nWith an average age of 60 years and over, patients with non-traumatic SCIs are clearly older at onset than traumatic cases [15\u201318].\n\nAge adapted neurorehabilitation The increasing age of patients with stroke, SCI, or other neu- rological diseases described in the previous sections becomes more and more apparent in rehabilitation settings. It is therefore worthwhile to consider the consequences of the growing num- ber of elderly patients on rehabilitation procedures. Although advancing age is an independent predictor of both short- and long-term survival after stroke [19] it is important to acknowl- edge that age is not an exclusion criteria or limiting factor for neurorehabilitation of the elderly stroke patient [20]. There are no specific handling methods or concepts for the ageing per- son. Members of the rehabilitation team working with the age- ing adult need to understand typical changes in all systems with advancing age and adapt the principles of rehabilitation accordingly.",

Neurorehabilitation should therefore be goal directed and requires a structure that is transparent to all members of the rehabilitation team. The variety of professional collaboration requires a common language that is applicable beyond professional barriers, in order to achieve the optimum rehabilitation outcome. The biopsychosocial model of the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) can serve as such an ori- entation for many processes of neurorehabilitation.

It is clinically characterized by pain, stiffness, functional impairment, and lim- ited movement, as well as deformations in later stages [24]. OA occurs most frequently in the knee, hip, and hand joints with the consequence of walking- and upper extremity-related disabilities.",

Additionally, a loss of muscle mass, and hence voluntary muscle power takes place. It is reported that this age-related sarcopenia starts in the fourth decade with 80% being lost in the eighth decade. This sarcope- nia is caused by multiple factors. Inactivity, age-related molecular changes, malnutrition, and other reasons are reported to be asso- ciated with the decline in muscle mass. Inactivity can partially be explained by the interference with other diseases that lead to pain and fatigue [26, 27]. The reduction of age-related muscle mass is often associated with an increase in fat mass, resulting in sarco- penic obesity [28].",

Mahnke et al. have stated in their research that the ageing person with a stroke does have neuro- plasticity and capability to learn. Rehabilitation specialists must be capable of delivering therapies that drive neural reorganization and learning. \u2018Driving brain plasticity with positive outcomes requires engaging older adults in demanding sensory, cognitive, and motor activities on an intensive basis, in a behavioural con- text designed to re-engage and strengthen the neuromodulatory systems that control learning in adults\u2019 [35]. Recent literature sug- gests that the principles of motor learning are of importance for relearning motor tasks and to drive neuroplasticity and central nervous system (CNS) reorganization after neurological impair- ment. One fundamental element is that of repetition. Repetitive exercises should be performed in continual problem solving sit- uations and meaningful goals that drive the patient to practice [36]. Several investigations showed that rehabilitation outcome depends on training intensity (for review see [37, 38]. Older patients may perceive such intense trainings as more challenging than their younger counterparts. Nevertheless, there is evidence that the principle of augmented therapy works in clinical practice. As little as 16 hours of additional training within 6 months after the incident led to small, yet measurable, improvements of out- comes in patients with stroke [39].",

Although somewhat counterintuitive, several investigations show that age is inde- pendent from rehabilitation LOS in stroke [52\u201354] and SCI [55]. Other authors report longer LOS for the very old [56]. It has to be borne in mind that rehabilitation services provision varies widely between countries. However, from a clinical point of view older patients need longer training periods to achieve their goals. This is partially due to the fact that training intensity has to be adapted to the frail body system or that medical insta- bility interferes with the rehabilitative training. Elderly clients also appear to be more tired and recover their general health post stroke more slowly than younger ones. Elderly patients do exhibit difficulties to translate skills and abilities learned within a therapeutic context to everyday life situations. As an example, it has been shown in a cohort of 237 patients with traumatic SCI from different European rehabilitation settings that, although older patients had a favourable recovery of neurological deficits, the improvement in functional tasks was worse compared to younger patients [55].",

Loneliness happens with ageing in any case when the person gradually loses their friends and acquaintances. In this case, a better solution could be specialized nursing facilities with educated rehabilitation staff, appropriate therapies, and contact with others.\n\nIf the personal and environmental context factors are such that the patient probably will not be able to go home, social services should be involved soon so there is time to find the best place for the patient to live upon discharge.",

With elderly patients, different tests or other thresh- olds or endpoints may be appropriate than with younger patients. The rehabilitation goal might be accomplished when an old patient is able to move around the house independently whereas younger patients also train to go to the community The Functional Independence Measure (FIM) [59] is done routinely in many cen- tres by the nursing staff and gives good information regarding the patient\u2019s functional status at the activity level. Physical therapists use different tests for different stages in recovery. At the very low FIM level, one can use the early functional abilities test [60] or the trunk control test [61]. Balance and risk for falling can be tested using the Berg Balance Scale [62] or the Performance Oriented Mobility Assessment [63]. Timed tests are very useful for gait. Upper extremity function can be tested with the nine-hole peg test [64] or the Wolf motor function test [65]. All patients can be tested using the Goal Attainment Scale [66]. The point is that therapists must have objective findings and be able to make clear statements regarding improvement or change.",

It is often seen for research purposes that groups of young and old patients are being compared regarding several outcomes. One has to bear in mind, however, that age might not be the only dif- ference between such groups. Survival, for example, is different in young and old patients. Older patients still alive and referred to rehabilitation may be healthier than their younger counterparts. Depending on the research question such survival effects need to be controlled for. It is also known that pre-existing conditions are sometimes under-reported [68]. There might also be a selection bias in that only patients who have the potential to meet the chal- lenge of rehabilitation are referred to specialized centres [69].",

Instead of a positive, creative environment to try novel therapies, there may be a situation of antagonism. Evidence, with its translation into the clinic, should be a circular integration of best research evidence, clinical exper- tise, and patient values [71].\n\nAn example of an intervention with good evidence is con- straint induced movement therapy (CIMT). CIMT emphasizes task-oriented training, meaningful patient goals, active partici- pation, and repetition. The so called, \u2018forced-use\u2019 of the affected upper extremity with goal-oriented therapy has excellent results for the patients who meet the inclusion criteria. Also, modified CIMT, meaning less hours per day practice over a longer period of time, has also very good outcome results. This therapy, translated from science into practice, can be used in the rehab setting but also at home. The patients who profit the most from this therapy are not cognitively impaired and have some functional recovery in their upper extremities [72].",

Patients with SCI account to about a tenth of the cases with stroke.\n\nThe basis for modern comprehensive SCI rehabilitation was estab- lished during World War II when a substantial number of patients with SCI were transferred home [73]. These cases and those who followed after the War were mostly young men who experienced their spinal cord lesion in a traumatic event. Accordingly, assess- ments and interventions were tailored to the features of this spe- cific patient group. However, there is indication from the literature that the mean age at injury has been increasing in the last decades. More importantly the proportion of cases with non-traumatic SCI is growing and almost exceeds that of traumatic cases [16, 74\u201376]. One characteristic of the latter group is the markedly older age. So, when considering patients who sustain a SCI with advanced age the cause is most likely of non-traumatic nature.",

A pre-existing, often clinically non-symptomatic myelopathy due to degenerative pro- cesses of the cervical spine in combination with a small trauma, results in CCS.

For example, such a comparison might be influenced by survival effects. Without the SCI older patients have a more favorable survival rate as compared to the younger group. Observational studies suggest that neurological and functional outcome after SCI is related to the patients\u2019 age at injury (e.g. [80]). However, it is likely that age is not independent from other pre- dictors like severity of injury. As mentioned earlier, older patients experience more incomplete SCI, which is associated with a bet- ter outcome. Accordingly, neurological outcome seems not to be negatively influenced by age. It seems, however, that older patients fail to translate their favourable neurological recovery into func- tional abilities [55, 81].",

Risks for strokes and other neurological conditions increase with age. The elderly patient will probably have more comorbidities than the younger patient. In spite of this, the elderly have neu- rorehabilitation potential. Preserved neuroplasticity, the potential to train muscular strength, cardio-vascular endurance and joint flexibility does not stop at a certain age. Therapy methods and concepts are not particularly age related. They need to be adapted in intensity to the person\u2019s capabilities.

Krakauer\n\nIntroduction Statements to the effect that recovery is a form of learning or relearning are commonplace in the field of neurorehabilitation. In this chapter, motor training will refer to what is done to the patient and motor learning will refer to what the patient may do in response. This distinction is important\u2014just because train- ing is happening does not mean that anything is being learned. The relearning premise for neurorehabilitation is based on three other a priori assumptions. First, that the nature of the deficit to be rehabilitated through learning is known. Second, that the kind of motor learning that should be targeted by training is known. Third, that patients after stroke have an intact learn- ing capacity despite impaired performance. In this chapter the focus will be mainly on rehabilitation of arm paresis after stroke, which results from damage to motor cortical areas and/ or their descending pathways. This narrower focus is essential if the topic of learning and neurorehabilitation is to remain within the bounds of a single chapter. That said it is hoped that the gen- eral principles introduced here, which will be emphasized over details, are broadly applicable across the range of post-stroke impairments and to other neurological conditions.",

Non-neural peripheral changes in muscle, joint and tendon prop- erties can also contribute to the paresis phenotype. In this chapter it will be assumed that treatments for strength, tone (spasticity) and contractures are not based on motor learning principles and so will not be addressed further. Note again that one can train for strength but this is not motor learning. Thus, the starting point for this chapter is that when learning is invoked it implies either improving motor control or finding alternative compensatory strategies with effectors/joints/muscles in which motor control remains relatively intact; in either case, response to training is assumed to have mechanistic commonalities with motor learn- ing in healthy subjects. It will become apparent after reading this chapter that the assumption that one can equate recovery and motor learning is subject to several fundamental caveats.",

Motor learning is a fuzzy category that encompasses action selection guided by instruction, reward, or error, and sub- sequent improved execution of the selected actions. Skill is a very popular term but is hard to define. Here, it will suffice to say that one is skilled at a task when practice has led to it being performed better than baseline because of selection of optimal mean actions that are then executed with high speed and precision. We will briefly describe the motor learning components in the following section. A question that should always be kept in mind is whether these components of motor learning are relevant or effective in reversing identified motor deficits after stroke or any other neu- rological condition.",

Similarly, the existence of physical and occupational thera- pists attests to the crucial role of instruction in rehabilitation. We have recently posited [2] that neglect of the crucial roles of knowledge and instruction for motor learning originates in part from an over-emphasis on simple implicit adaptation tasks due to the classic result in the patient H.M., who retained memory of mirror-drawing ability across days despite no explicit memory of ever having performed the task [3]. This led, in our view, to over-generalization of the notion of procedural learning/mem- ory from this simple task to all motor skills. We have recently argued instead that everyday motor skills such as cooking or driving cannot be extrapolated from motor adaptation tasks and cannot be learned without knowledge and instruction [2]. In agreement with our position, a recent paper has shown that a motor task with redundant structure cannot be learned with- out explicit awareness of this structure [4]. We, and others, have recently shown that even adaptation tasks have a crucial explicit component [5, 6].",

For example, if a person is given a pair of skis and told to get down a mountain, they may well find a way to do so on their own but they are very unlikely to discover the best technique, which would require instruction and more extended practice. Later in the chap- ter we will argue that compensatory strategies after stroke often represent precisely this kind of premature adoption of habitual \u2018just good enough\u2019 actions.

    "text": "Sensorimotor adaptation refers to reduction of errors in response to a perturbation. Sensorimotor adaptation tasks have been extensively studied experimentally and modeled computationally [8\u201311]. The prevailing idea is that adapta- tion occurs through cerebellar-dependent reduction of errors through updating of a forward model via sensory prediction errors [12, 13]. The relevance of adaptation to rehabilitation remains unclear, however, because although imposed errors can lead to fast and large changes in behaviour, these changes do not seem to last once the perturbation is removed. For example, the paretic arm can be made adapt to a viscous force field set to amplify baseline directional reaching biases. When the force field is switched off, aftereffects are now in a direc- tion that negates the biases [14]. A similar \u2018error augmentation\u2019 approach has been used using a split-belt treadmill to reduce step asymmetry in hemiparetic gait [15]. In both cases, how- ever, the desirable aftereffects are very short lived. In the case of force-field adaptation of the arm, after effects lasted for only 30\u201360 movements after 600 training movements [14]. More recently it has been shown that repeated exposure over multiple sessions prolongs split-belt treadmill over-ground after-effects in patients with stroke [16]. Interestingly, repeated exposure is also required for prism adaptation in the treatment of neglect after stroke [17]. One explanation for the short-lived nature of adaptation is that newly adapted behaviours are out-competed by baseline behaviours that have been reinforced over much longer periods of time and have become habits. In support of this idea is the recent finding that if a newly adapted behaviour, once it has",

Plasticity refers to the capacity of the nervous sys- tem to change its input\u2013output characteristics with various forms of training. These input\u2013output relationships can be assayed in a variety of ways, which include single-unit recording in animal models and non-invasive brain stimulation in humans. Learning does imply that a plastic change has occurred but a plastic change does not imply that learning of a new behaviour has occurred. Thinking otherwise is to commit the classic logical fallacy called \u2018affirming the consequent\u2019: (1) If P, then Q. (2) Q. (3) Therefore, P. Unfortunately, a sizable literature appears to consider UDP important to neurorehabilitation, based largely on this logical fallacy. To appreciate the misunderstanding, consider the classic paper in this area by Classen and colleagues [21]. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex was used to evoke isolated and directionally consistent thumb movements through activation of the abductor pollicis brevis muscle. Subjects were then required to practice thumb movements for 30 minutes in the direction approximately opposite to that elicited by TMS. The critical finding was that subsequent TMS was found to evoke movements in or near the direction practiced rather than in the pre-training baseline direction. This is a very interesting result with regard to how movement repetition (it is not really training in so much as the goal is not to improve performance in any way) can lead to changes in cortical representation. Indeed, a very simi- lar mechanism is likely at play in the series of controversial papers published by Graziano and colleagues showing that long",

To appreciate this objection, consider the thumb experi- ment; although TMS after training causes the thumb to move in a direction roughly similar to the one practised, if a subject is asked to move their thumb in the original pretrained direction they do not suddenly find themselves going in reverse! That is to say, the plastic changes assayed with TMS have not changed voluntary behaviour. Now it is true that when looked for, movement repeti- tions in one direction can lead to small biases in other directions [24\u201326] but these biases are only a fraction of the trained direction and can be easily over-ridden in a few trials. Thus at the current time, experiments that induce UDP are informative about how the brain changes with repetition but these changes do not lead to learning of new task-relevant behaviours. Further support for this conclusion comes from the many reported failures of haptic and robotic guidance to benefit training [27, 28]. It appears that the interest in these cortical epiphenomena is out of proportion to their practical usefulness for neurorehabilitation.",

As has already been alluded to for the case of adaptation, acquisition is not of great use if what is learned is not retained across sessions. In addi- tion to retention, it is hoped that training the limb on a task in the rehabilitation clinic will generalize to other activities of daily living. It is surprising how little investigation there has been of retention and generalization of motor learning in the context of neurorehabilitation. One possible reason is that, as we argue here, rehabilitation is mainly compensatory and does not generalize because learning to compensate suffers from the same \u2018curse of task specificity\u2019 as normal motor learning [29]. A notable exception, as already mentioned, is work performed by Bastian and colleagues looking at retention of split-belt treadmill adaptation and its generalization to over-ground walking [16].",

It should be immediately apparent that if the neural substrate that gener- ates motor commands is damaged, for example the corticospi- nal tract (CST) after a capsular infarct, then learning might not be expressible, even if normal [30]. This example should already make it clear that learning is not, on the face of it, an obvious mechanism for reversal of a stroke\u2019s effect on performance. It will be argued here that motor learning in response to rehabili- tative training after stroke can only operate within the residual performance envelope that the remaining nervous system is capable of after spontaneous biological recovery is complete. That is to say, based on reasoning and current empirical data, the null position taken in this chapter is that motor learning in response to training in the period after spontaneous biological recovery is complete cannot reverse the loss of motor control but is only relevant to learning of compensatory strategies.",

    "text": "(impairment) occurs in a time-limited window or sensitive period post-stroke; such training-independent recovery is often referred to as spontaneous biological recovery [31]. The sensitive period lasts about 3 months in humans [32, 33] and 1 month in rodents [34]. Evidence suggests that most recovery occurs within the sensi- tive period because of a unique plasticity environment that is initi- ated by ischaemia and falls off as a function of time and distance from the infarct. This post-ischaemic environment can be char- acterized by unique changes in gene expression, in the structure and physiology of synapses, and in excitatory/inhibitory balance [31, 35\u201337]. The crucial point to be made here is that spontaneous biological recovery in the sensitive period is not motor learning per se but an endogenous repair process that presumably relies on residual intact neural architecture as a template for reorganiza- tion. That the repair process may interact with and be augmented by training is of great importance, but task-specific training is not necessary for spontaneous biological recovery [38] and training alone cannot reproduce spontaneous biological recovery outside of the sensitive period. A clear demonstration that recovery can occur in the absence of directed training is the predictable change in the Fugl-Meyer Scale (FMS) between the first week after stroke and 3 months later [33, 39]. The FMS tests the ability to isolate joints and to make multi-joint movements in and out of synergy. As the FMS does not have functional components it is never used for training, nevertheless the FMS can dramatically improve in the sensitive period (Figure 7.1).",

    "text": "The obvious question is how to combine the task specificity of training with the general recovery allowed by spontaneous bio- logical recovery in the sensitive period? Experiments in animal models suggest that the response of the brain to training in the sensitive period is uniquely enhanced and that this responsive- ness diminishes as the interval between the stroke and training is increased. In one influential experiment in rats, it was dem- onstrated that starting re-training 5 days after stroke was much more effective than waiting 2 weeks. By one month the efficacy of task-specific training was not greater than social housing alone. These results, and others, strongly suggest that motor learning in the sensitive period is qualitatively different from motor learning in the chronic state and in healthy animals, and bears similarities to conditions early in development [31, 40]. In primates, a partial ischaemic lesion in motor cortex leads to loss of hand dexterity that recovers fully if training is initially early but is lost completely if delayed [41]. As of this writing, two crucial questions remain unanswered in the case of humans: (1) Does any form of rehabili- tation in the sensitive period enhance the generalizing effects of spontaneous biological recovery? (2) Is the response to any given amount of task-specific training greater inside versus outside the sensitive period? These questions are a challenge to address and so it is not so surprising that we do not yet know the answers to them. One problem is that studies need to be adequately powered to detect additional changes riding on top of spontaneous biologi- cal recovery. Another is that it is almost certainly necessary to provide high intensity and dosage of",

Data from the animal literature sug- gest that this dosage of repetitions is too low; changes in synap- tic density in the primary motor cortex occur after 400 but not 60 reaches [44, 45]. In most rodent stroke recovery studies that use reaching as part of the rehabilitation protocol, there is often no limit imposed on the amount of reaching allowed; rats will typically reach 300 times in a training session.

Subsequently, however, the same group of investigators asked the same question for ischaemic lesions using a middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) model in the rat. Here the results are more equivocal. In the case when 45 minutes of MCAO caused moderate cortical ischaemia, 10 days of casting of the unaffected limb did not lead to exaggeration of infarct volume but did lead to worse behavioural performance [50]. For more severe corti- cal ischaemia, induced by 90 minutes of three-vessel occlusion, there was no deleterious effect on lesion volume or outcome. In a distal MCAO model that caused subcortical (striatal) infarction, forced non-use but not over-use of the affected forelimb led to detrimental behavioural outcomes but without exaggeration of lesion size [50]. More recently, the same investigators failed to show a behavioural consequence of casting the unaffected limb despite exaggerations of cortical lesion volume [51]. Indeed in this study, as in the earlier subcortical study, it was disuse of the affected forelimb that had detrimental effects. Importantly, in these later experiments the cast was smaller and lighter and the rats were housed in larger cages with littermates. Carmichael and colleagues have revisited the effects of overuse. They induced overuse of the affected forelimb one day after the stroke by using Botox in the unaffected limb; there was no increase in infarct size with this approach [52] but the same authors have demon- strated that there is instability in cortical excitability for about 3 to 5 days post-stroke [36, 53].",

Here, the term compensation will be restricted to changes in effector, joints and muscles, and not to use of external aids such as walkers, canes, or orthoses. In this framework, motor learning in patients with chronic hemiparesis is in no way different to a healthy person learning to write with their non-dominant arm after breaking their dominant arm, or learning to lean forward and shuffle when walking on a slippery surface.

Thus it cannot be ruled out that it is immobilization of the unaffected side that is the problem rather than overuse of the affected side. A conservative approach, to allay lingering fears about early exac- erbation, might be to ramp up the dose and intensity over the first 5 days post-stroke in the case of large cortical infarcts. It should also be emphasized that CIMT is not the only way to instigate early use of the affected side. For example, increased dosage and intensity of training could be accomplished by robotic therapy of the affected side without any need to immobilize the unaffected side but there have been very few studies of robotics in the first 3 months after stroke to date.",

The technique has two compo- nents: (1) Restraint of the less affected arm and/or hand with a sling or mitten for 90% of waking hours. (2) Task-oriented prac- tice with the affected side using a form of training called shaping. The weightings for the two components and the length of the over- all treatment have varied considerably in studies since the original trial. It is perhaps under-appreciated that EXCITE was based on some well-thought-out principles first established in de-afferented monkeys by Taub and colleagues. A chapter on motor learning and rehabilitation is a good place to consider the learning princi- ples underlying CIMT in more detail and ask whether they were well suited to application to hemiparesis after stroke in humans.",

Significant decreases in impairment occur almost exclu- sively in the first 3 months after stroke as a result of an interaction between spontaneous biological recovery and training in this sen- sitive period. As already outlined, conventional neurorehabilita- tion in the sensitive period is so low in dose and intensity that it fails to exploit the unique potential for motor learning. Instead, patients are prematurely made to learn compensatory strategies when they should be focusing on reducing impairment in the short time available.",

In this paper, the authors presented their new rehabilitation framework based on experiments in monkeys that had been deafferented in one forelimb via dorsal rhizotomy. The key observation was that the monkeys did not resume use of the de-afferented limb even after spinal shock had resolved and use of the limb was again possible. The explanation was that early on when the limb was severely impaired, the monkeys learned that it was useless through negative reinforcement. This learn- ing became a habit despite return of a latent capacity that was not explored. The authors discovered that the habit of non-use could be overcome if the good limb was restrained over days. In addition to use of the restraint, the authors also re-trained the limb in two different ways. In conditioned response training, the monkeys were made to make isolated repetitive movements across single joints and resist against loads. It was noted that these exercises",

    "text": "EXCITE showed that patients who received CIMT for 2 weeks had greater responses in a test of motor function and in self-report of performance quality in common daily activities. There was no assessment of motor impairment [7] . What is CIMT accomplish- ing? Evidence suggests that it is not leading to either significant reductions in impairment or a return to closer to normal levels of motor control [64]. Instead patients seem to be learning to com- pensate better for their deficit by practising particular tasks using intact residual capacities. The subtle but critical point is that, unlike in the case of a monkey\u2019s recovery from spinal shock, patients are not discovering a capacity that they lost and then latently regained. Instead compensatory strategies in the chronic state are performed with capacities that were present from the time of the stroke or were recovered in the sensitive period; they just had not been incorporated into functional tasks through practice. Thus while it seems that an operant approach, as in de-afferented mon- keys, does teach useful compensatory strategies in patients after stroke, the mechanistic parallels between CIMT after stroke and after de-afferentation are limited. Learned non-use has never been documented in humans, nor is there evidence of a latent return of capacity in the chronic state. Mention of plasticity and reor- ganization in the setting of CIMT is misleading unless these terms are thought to apply equally to healthy subjects. For example, to also occur when a healthy person\u2019s elbow is splinted into flexion so that within a few attempts they flex their trunk to make a reach- ing movement.

    "text": "Robotic therapy It is of historical interest that the most popular robotic device for therapy of the upper limb after stroke evolved from the same planar robot used in initial ground-breaking studies of a form of motor learning, force-field adaptation [8] . Two distinct approaches have since been used with robots in the setting of therapy. One approach has been to have the robot guide or constrain the arm to more normal straight trajectories (i.e. shaping). Alternatively, robot-applied force fields may be used to make patients\u2019 trajectory errors even larger than their baseline errors (error augmentation [14]). Here, the idea is that when the force field is switched off, immediate after-effects will be more similar to normal movements. Thus two very different kinds of motor learning have been used with the same robotic device: incremental reinforcement (shap- ing) versus fast error-based learning (adaptation). Interestingly, the data suggest that the former approach has small but lasting effects [65], whereas the latter has impressive but short-lived effects [14]. Similarly, an increasingly investigated split-belt treadmill",

Planar movements have a unique solution in joint space if the trunk is restrained, which means that it is not compensatory movements that are being trained but instead an attempt is being made to have subjects regain more normal motor control. Thus, robotics is quite different from CIMT. It is important to be clear on what kind of motor learning is being targeted by an approach and whether the goal is impairment reduction or compensation. It is of interest that although not intentional, both CIMT and robotics have reinforcement as their core learning mechanism but ended up having differential efficacy on function and impairment, respectively.",

The largest robotics trial to date treated patients with chronic stroke (> 6 months) using the MIT-Manus device [66] with results that were essentially negative: patients who received robotic therapy gained only 2 Fugl-Meyer points over the usual care group. A minimum meaningful effect size for the FMS is a change of 7 [67]. A meta-analysis of robotic therapy has also reported a very small FMS change overall [65]. Despite unimpres- sive results, there are very important lessons to be learned from the Veterans Association ROBOTICS study. First, the study showed that standard of care has no effect at all on impairment, disability or quality of life. This observation alone cries out for the need for new treatments. Second, therapists outside of a research setting would not be able to consistently provide doses of assisted arm movements of around 1,000 per session (the average in real-world settings is 20\u201345). Third, there were no serious adverse events in 49 patients who performed 1,024 movements per session with the robot, three times a week for 12 weeks.",

This window had closed by the time patients were enrolled in almost all the robotic studies to date. Only five robotic trials have been conducted in the first 3 months after stroke, with only one of these showing a FMS change of 5 or more (68). It is not enough, how- ever, to provide robotic therapy in the first 3 months; the kinds of movement will also almost certainly matter. The MIT-Manus robot trains patients to make non-ecological horizontal planar movements; the shoulder and elbow are level with each other. In a very interesting study, six healthy subjects were given a wear- able motion-tracking system to record their arm movements as they went about their daily life [69]. Despite the large range of pos- sible movements, the investigators found that during most nor- mal everyday tasks the arms are confined to a small volume of space around the body and movements are predominantly in the vertical, not the horizontal, plane across a variety of tasks. Thus it could be objected that trials with the MIT-Manus and other single joint or planar devices may have failed not because they were outside the sensitive period, but because patients were not trained on functional movements. This possibility has now been addressed in a recently published trial in chronic stroke that used a 3D exoskeletal robot with 7 degrees of freedom [70]. Patients in",

    "text": "Does stroke have an effect on motor learning? The question of whether learning and not just motor control is impaired after stroke is asked surprisingly infrequently [71]. The question itself can be misunderstood and is also very difficult to answer for methodological reasons. First of all, the relevant ques- tion is not whether or not certain strategically localized strokes can cause learning deficits, because the answer is clearly yes. For example, we know that cerebellar and parietal infarcts can have detrimental effects on visuomotor adaptation [72\u201374]. The criti- cal question is whether the infarcts in motor cortical areas and/or their output pathways that cause hemiparesis also cause a learn- ing deficit. At the time of writing, it has not been convincingly demonstrated that there is a learning deficit in the paretic arm after stroke [71]. One reason that the question is very difficult to answer is that there is a no assumption-free way to compare learn- ing rate, retention or generalization between patients and con- trols when the levels of initial performance are not matched, as is the obviously case in the setting of hemiparesis. Any attempt to match through normalization, either additive or multiplica- tive, makes unproven assumptions and can lead to contradictory results [75]. The only way forward is to either have a good justifi- able a priori learning model that is predicated on either additive or multiplicative effects, or to try and stratify patients who overlap performance-wise with controls. Such stratification is treacherous because of regression to the mean\u2014one may be conditioning on noise rather than comparing true overlapping high values from one group and low values from another, and therefore",

In the chronic phase, motor learning is normal and only leads to task-specific compensatory effects rather than any true reversal of the paretic deficit. It is to be hoped that in the future, pharmacological agents (e.g. selective serotonin receptor inhibitors [76]), trophic support from stem cells, and brain stimulation techniques will augment [77], extend and even re-open the sensitive period in the chronic period [78, 79]. Most clinicians can provide anecdotes about patients who made true progress at the impairment level way beyond the 3-month sen- sitive period; such patients are also to be found in reported clinical trials. Whether these late responding patients comprise a special subset remains to be investigated but several possibilities suggest themselves. One is that these patients are outliers with respect to the sensitive period. Another is that their main deficit is not clas- sic CST hemiparesis\u2014for example, they have proprioceptive loss, dystonia, or apraxia. Another may be biomechanical or periph- eral, for example, fixing one part of the system (e.g. painful or stiff shoulder) allows apparent reduction in impairment elsewhere (dis- tally). Finally, perhaps something has allowed them to reopen their sensitive period to training. In the mean time, the best hope for patients with hemiparesis after stroke is to greatly increase the dose and intensity of impairment-focused therapy for the first 3 months after stroke based on the new findings with regard to learning, plasticity, and neural repair in this sensitive period.",

Several experimental approaches in animal models indicate promising findings con- cerning a partial repair of damaged neuronal tracts even after a severe SCI in humans. The main experimental strategies for repair include: (i) neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory treatments; (ii) enhancement of axonal fibre regeneration and compensatory axonal sprouting; and (iii) transplantation of bridges or stem cells [1] . Most of these treatment strategies show some improvement in animal models on the anatomical and/or the functional level [2, 3]. However, the current situation with regard to translate these experimental treatments to human SCI is less convincing.",

Evidence arose from studies in subjects with chronic motor-complete SCI that the function of spinal neuronal cir- cuits below the level of lesion is impaired [14, 15]\u2014that is when signs of a \u2018negative\u2019 neuroplasticity become apparent. The pres- ervation of spinal neuronal function below the level of lesion is an important prerequisite for the success of any kind of future regeneration-inducing therapies. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to summarize the alterations of spinal neuronal circuits that lack supraspinal input after an SCI and stroke, and to discuss potential countermeasures to prevent neuronal dysfunction in the chronic stage of the injury.",

Several factors could explain the discrepancy in results between animal models and clinical studies, such as differences in the level and type of lesion, or the treatment onset. For example, treatments in rodents are usually administered directly after the injury, while treatment effects in the subacute and chronic stage of rodent SCI are less usual and little understood [11]. In humans, however, repair treatments are frequently delayed until a chronic stage (ca. 1 year post-lesion) because at this time the clinical condition is more stable and no spontaneous neurological recovery is expected [12].",

Within the last 10 years such assessments, mainly performed in subjects with motor-complete SCI and hemiparetic stroke revealed significant alterations in spinal neuronal function several months after injury [14, 15, 17].

During this phase locomotor ability is lost, and no polysynaptic SR can be evoked, but H-reflex is still present [33]. Approximately 6 weeks after the injury, when spinal shock vanishes, an early SR compo- nent (latency ~80 ms) which is normally present in neurologi- cally intact healthy subjects (see Figure 8.1B), reappears following tibial nerve stimulation [15, 33]. A comparable phenomenon of SR behaviour can be observed in rats with complete spinal cord tran- section [34, 35]. The reappearance of SR activity is accompanied by the capability to induce a locomotor EMG activity in both rats [34] and humans [15, 36] when an appropriate proprioceptive input (loading, hip extension) is provided during assisted leg movements with body weight support, for example, by a driven gait orthosis.

Recordings of SR show successively smaller amplitudes of the early reflex component, while H-reflex remains unchanged [33].\n\nIn the transition phase (between 6 and 12 months after SCI) a shift from dominant early to dominant late SR components occurs [15]. Clinically, a complete SCI at this stage is characterized by the development of spasticity including increased muscle tone, spasms, and exaggerated tendon tap reflexes. Several studies have indicated that long-latency (or polysynaptic) reflexes are reduced in amplitude after SCI or stroke and that the increased muscle tone at this and later stages of the central neural lesion cannot be explained by a neuronal hyperactivity but, rather by secondarily occurring non-neuronal changes, such as altered muscle mechan- ics [37, 38]. Changes in mechanical muscle properties can involve loss of sarcomeres, changes in muscle\u2013joint relationship [39], and the properties of collagen tissue and tendons. These changes can partly compensate for paresis and allow support of body weight during walking in incomplete SCI and stroke subjects, as seen in the condition of spastic movement disorder (for review see [40]).",

In contrast to SCI subjects, hemiparetic stroke subjects have partially preserved neuronal interactions between the unaffected and the affected leg [46, 47], which might lead to different alterations in spinal neu- ronal circuitries compared to SCI. It has been shown that also in stroke subjects polysynaptic SR undergo changes in the chronic stage, such as the development of a dominant late SR component [17]. However, in contrast to SCI subjects, this late component was only present in the affected leg of severely disabled chronic stroke subjects [17]. Another difference to SCI subjects was that in stroke subjects the dominant late SR component was not associated with an EMG exhaustion of leg muscle activity during assisted loco- motion, even when stepping movements were performed solely by the affected leg [17]. Explanations for these differences between chronic hemiparetic stroke and SCI subjects might be the com- pensatory function of the unaffected leg and the interlimb interac- tions in stroke subjects. This would be in line with the neuronal coupling between the affected and unaffected legs during locomo- tion [46, 48]. Another explanation could be the observation that an improvement in walking ability is not associated with a change in leg muscle activation and the small, little modulated EMG amplitude in the affected leg during walking after stroke [49, 50].

In contrast, the persistent possibility to induce a locomotor pattern by assisted walking in motor-complete SCI subjects even more than 25 years after the injury favours the assumption that the changes in locomotor and SR function in chronic SCI origin from a shift towards the dominance of inhibitory drive within neuronal cir- cuits leading to a neuronal dysfunction, rather than from a degra- dation of neuronal function. Another argument that strengthens the latter assumption is the finding that locomotor EMG exhaus- tion and development of a dominant late SR component can be reversed by intensive locomotor training in motor-incomplete SCI subjects [16]. Thus, the functional state of spinal neuronal cir- cuitries is not fixed, but rather plastic and it can be altered by an appropriate training [16] (see section \u2018Countermeasures and clini- cal impact\u2019).",

Afferent input from muscles, joints, and skin receptors interact dynamically with spinal neuronal circuitries and this interaction shapes the locomotor activity (for review see [57]). The most relevant proprioceptive input to activate spinal locomotor circuitries in subject with SCI originates from load and hip joint recep- tors [25, 58]. Load information is provided from leg exten- sor muscles (namely Ib afferent signals from Golgi tendon organs), and probably also from mechanoreceptors in the foot sole [59]. In addition, the following observations highlight the significance of hip joint receptors in the activation of spinal neuronal circuits underlying the generation of a locomotor pattern [27]. Robotic assisted locomotion with blocked knee and/or ankle joint movements induces a \u2018normal\u2019 locomotor EMG activity in motor-complete SCI subjects.

    "text": "Neuromodulatory approaches The importance of appropriate afferent information from periph- eral receptors as a source of activating spinal neuronal circuitries became obvious from experiments in completely transected ani- mals and motor-complete SCI subjects during the last decades. Reduced proprioceptive feedback after an SCI has a negative impact on spinal neuronal function as well as on the concurrent recovery of locomotor function. Therefore, besides an intensive functional training, tools to artificially activate spinal neuronal circuits are needed. Several neuromodulatory strategies aim to increase excitability of spinal neuronal circuitries in order to tune their physiological state to a level that leads to a locomotor facilitation and might even counteract the development of spinal neuronal dysfunction in chronic SCI subjects. Examples of such potential strategies include continuous vibration of the quadri- ceps and hamstring muscle groups [61], continuous electrical stimulation of the peroneal or sural nerves [62], and magnetic stimulation of the spinal cord [63]. The latter approach, applied repetitively over the thoracolumbar spine, was able to activate spi- nal locomotor circuitries in healthy subjects. However, so far there is no evidence that this kind of non-noxious magnetic stimula- tion is able to enhance spinal neuronal activity and, consequently evoke a locomotor activity also in SCI subjects. Electrical epidural stimulation at the thoracolumbar level of the spinal cord in com- plete SCI subjects could induce locomotor EMG activity [64\u201366]. Besides electrical or magnetic stimulation approaches, various pharmacological agents, such as serotonergic and noradrenergic agonists, can increase spinal neuronal",

The proposed cause of this \u2018negative\u2019 neuroplasticity is a bias to inhibitory signalling within spinal neuronal circuitries. It is assumed that immobility with its associated loss of appropriate proprioceptive feedback to spinal neuronal circuitries weakens the excitatory drive within spinal neuronal networks and leads to the bias of an inhibitory drive in interneuronal activity. Countermeasures to prevent or to reverse the development of neuronal dysfunction include inten- sive training approaches in combination with stimulation tech- niques.

Prog Brain Res. 2007;161:217\u2013233.\n\nRecently, two novel promising, non-invasive techniques, called paired associative stimulation [68\u201370] and transcutaneous spinal direct current stimulation (tsDCS) [71\u201374], have been applied in humans to modulate spinal neuronal excitability. The latter tech- nique is derived from transcranial direct current stimulation and influences spinal neuronal excitability by anodal or cathodal polarization of the cord tissue [75]. So far, tsDCS has been mainly applied in healthy subjects as a tool to modulate transsynaptic efficacy in monosynaptic [72, 74] and polysynaptic reflex path- ways [71]. Only one study has applied this technique in subjects with SCI. Increased amplitudes of polysynaptic SR after 20 min of anodal tsDCS were described [73]. This leads to the assumption that tsDCS can modulate spinal neuronal excitability in chronic SCI subjects. It remains to be determined whether anodal tsDCS can be used to counteract the development of spinal neuronal dys- function after severe SCI.",

These patients suffer a spastic movement disorder, with slowing of stepping and impaired voluntary limb movements. Clinical diag- nosis of spasticity is based on the combination of physical signs in the passive patient\u2014exaggerated tendon reflexes and muscle hypertonia defined as a velocity-dependent resistance of a muscle to stretching [1] . Spastic muscle tone can differently be distributed in flexor and extensor muscles as well as a focal or generalized increase in muscle tone can be experienced depending on the cause of the spastic symptoms [2].",

Second, exaggerated tendon reflexes are only a small part of the mechanisms that contribute to the control of functional move- ment, such as walking. Third, most studies on the effect of anti- spastic drugs are focused on isolated clinical signs, such as reflex activity, and not on the spastic movement disorder that hampers patients. Fourth, without the development of spastic muscle tone (e.g. after stroke/SCI), most patients would be unable to walk because of the paresis. Fifth, clinical examination of spasticity is done in the relaxed/passive patient and does not reflect the state of neuronal circuits within the CNS underlying natural movements such as walking.",

    "text": "One problem in the clinic when diagnosing spasticity is that it is not easy with the current applied methods, such as the Ashworth and the Tardieu scales, to distinguish between reflex and passive muscle-mediated changes [3, 4]. Also the term spasticity is incon- sistently defined and the measures used do not correspond to the clinical features of spasticity [5] .\n\nIn this chapter, we relate the definition of spasticity by Lance [1] to the knowledge of the mechanisms underlying the associ- ated movement disorder. On the basis of the clinical signs it was assumed in the past that neural overactivity, causing exaggerated reflexes, might be responsible for muscle hypertonia, which then leads to spastic movement disorder [6\u201310]. This view was sup- ported by experiments on decerebrate cats [[11], which showed that muscle tone during stretching is substantially reduced after severing the nerves involved in the stretch-reflex loop. Therefore, it became established that most treatment approaches should be directed to attenuate or abolish reflex activity and thereby to reduce muscle tone [6, 12].",

    "text": "This view did not take into account several points. First, the decerebrate cat is not an adequate model for human spasticity as rigid muscle tone develops immediately after decerebration, whereas human spasticity develops over weeks after acute lesions.\n\nNo convincing animal model exists for human spasticity (see [13]), perhaps because the pathophysiology of spasticity is multi- factorial. Any changes in the neuronal or biomechanical systems, for example differences in the site and duration of a central lesion, are of importance in determining which neural control mecha- nisms are deficient and contribute to the movement disorder [14]. Furthermore, such changes might already be secondary and compensatory to the primary dysfunction of sensorimotor sys- tems. There are some differences in the appearance of spasticity between spinal and supraspinal lesions and lesions of different ori- gin (e.g. inflammatory or traumatic). However, these factors have little influence on the impairment of function which essentially depends on the severity of CNS damage.",

In this chapter, we describe the role of reflex and muscle activity and muscle mechanics in patients with spasticity and the resulting muscle tone in two conditions (cf.

Exaggerated tendon tap reflexes of the affected limb muscles and an increased resistance of a muscle to stretching indicate the presence of spasticity caused by a central motor lesion.\n\nExaggerated reflexes: short-latency reflex activity The nature and mechanisms underlying exaggerated tendon reflex activity (monosynaptic or oligosynaptic segmental reflexes) have been the focus of many studies in patients with spasticity. The short-latency reflex activity is mediated by fast conducting group Ia nerve fibres from the muscle spindles to the spinal cord. A severe acute central lesion is associated with a loss of tendon tap reflexes followed by hyperreflexia which is suggested to be due to a neuronal reorganization in both cats [16] and humans [17, 18].",

Furthermore, increased reflex activity is not likely to be caused by either reduced recurrent inhibition of motoneurons via Renshaw cell activity [24, 25] or intraspinal nerve sprouting [26].\n\nThere is evidence for reduced presynaptic inhibition of Ia affer- ent fibres in leg muscles after SCI, but not in hemiplegic stroke subjects [27, 28], as a possible mechanism underlying exagger- ated tendon tap reflexes. However, there is no association between decreased presynaptic inhibition of Ia afferents and the degree of muscle hypertonia as assessed by the Ashworth scale [28].",

In contrast, the H-reflex (an electri- cally elicited short-latency reflex excluding muscle spindles) is already present during spinal shock when tendon reflexes cannot yet be elicited [18]. After 1\u20132 weeks, tendon reflexes and muscle tone reappear. At later stages (4\u20136 weeks) clinical signs of spastic- ity (i.e. exaggerated reflexes and increased muscle tone), become established. The loss of reflexes is usually attributed to a reduced excitability of alpha- and gamma motoneurons due to the sudden loss of input from supraspinal centres [18]. When spasticity has developed, the threshold of the soleus stretch reflex is decreased in patients with spasticity [38, 39], possibly due to an increase in alpha and gamma motoneuron excitability [40]. Repetitive clonic muscle contractions are more likely to be due to an impaired interaction of central and peripheral mechanisms than to a recur- rent stretch reflex activity [41].",

Furthermore, it seems that the sites where flexor reflexes can be elicited become expanded in patients with a spinal or supraspinal lesion as compared to healthy humans [45, 46].\n\nSeveral mechanisms are suggested to underlie flexor reflex activity after a CNS lesion. For example, spontaneous firing of motoneurons during rest was suggested to lead to muscle spasms [47, 48], initially caused by receptor upregulation and later on by neuronal sprouting [49, 50]. Flexor reflexes in patients with chronic SCI are also believed to reflect neuronal plateau potentials [37, 51].",

In line with this, patients with complete chronic SCI com- pared to healthy people show a lower incidence of the early flexor reflex component [43, 52] and they produce smaller leg joint tor- ques [53].

Consequently, it becomes evident that the abnormal stretch reflex activity is insufficient to explain increased muscle tone in people with spasticity [59, 63\u201365]. Reflex-mediated stiffness in the active ankle extensors [65] and elbow flexor mus- cles [40, 58, 66] in patients with spasticity can even be within the range of healthy controls and seems to be only slightly increased in patients with SCI [67]. From investigating the ankle joint stiff- ness in stroke, multiple sclerosis, and SCI participants Lorentzen et al [4] concluded that the clinical diagnosis of spasticity includes changes in both active and passive muscle properties, and the two can hardly be distinguished based on routine clinical examina- tion. The truth is still in the eye of the beholder [68]. Today, it is believed that a combination of mechanisms contributes to clini- cal spasticity, that is an increase in passive stiffness of a muscle to stretch due to changes in collagen tissue and tendons [59, 61, 65], an enhancement of intrinsic stiffness of muscle fibres (Gracies, 2005), and a loss of sarcomeres [69], leading to subclinical con- tractures (for review see [70]). In addition, morphometric and histochemical investigations changes take place in muscle-fibre properties [71\u201373] that might contribute to spastic muscle tone.

However, tension development at the Achilles tendon, resulting from a combination of muscle stiffness and EMG activity, can be recorded during locomotion.

On the unaffected side, changes in tension at the Achilles tendon parallel the amplitude of triceps surae electromyo- graphic activity. On the spastic side, the tension development is associated with a stretching of the triceps surae during the stance phase of gait. During this period, the leg extensor muscles are ton- ically activated with low electromyographic amplitude [77].

Attenuated integration of afferent feedback and a reduction of supraspinal drive lead to a tonic mode of leg muscle activity with a small EMG amplitude with the conse- quence of hampered walking. Secondary to a central lesion, changes in muscle, ligament, and tendon properties occur that compensate at part for the loss of supraspinal drive. The obvious consequence is the regulation of muscle tone on a simpler level (Figure 9.3). This behaviour of the spastic muscle allows for the support of the body during walking. This is also reflected in the fact that the level of spastic tone depends on the severity of paresis [112]. Therefore, such changes should be considered as adaptive to a primary disorder.",

Impaired walking is mainly caused by disabling paresis and impaired use of afferent input by spinal neuronal circuits [114] and not by spastic muscle tone [69]. As a result, antispastic medications that are directed to reduce clinical signs of spasticity, such as exaggerated reflexes and muscle tone, do not improve movement disorder [115\u2013119].

On the other hand, contractures of muscles and joints that are difficult to treat when established can be prevented at an early stage by frequent muscle stretching.

This is not surprising, as any form of functional training should be expected to improve locomotor ability in people with stroke and SCI [149]. An overground walking therapy, however, in severely affected patients requires the assistance of two physiothera- pists and therefore limits training time.

An understanding of its normal functions and pathophysiology is essential to improve diagnosis, investigation, and management in autonomic neurore- habilitation [1] .\n\nThe ANS, which is divided into the sympathetic and para- sympathetic systems, is primarily an efferent system. It receives its afferent input from many visceral afferent neurons, some- times interacting with somatic reflexes. The ANS has both cen- tral nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) components. The outflow of both the sympathetic and the para- sympathetic nervous system follows a two-neuron pathway, which consists of a preganglionic neuron located within the CNS and a postganglionic neuron located outside the CNS. Sympathetic fibres leave the CNS at the thoracolumbar level, and the para- sympathetic fibres leave at the craniosacral level. In general, the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems have opposing effects on visceral function. The hypothalamus serves as the major control centre for most ANS functions; local reflex circuits that interrelate visceral afferent and autonomic efferent activity are an integrated control system in the spinal cord and brainstem.",

    "text": "the hypothalamus, spinal cord, or the sympathetic nerves control- ling sweat glands could seriously impair perspiration leading to poor temperature control; likewise diseases or trauma in the brain stem, spinal cord, or parasympathetic nerves could lead to urinary retention and erectile dysfunction in men.\n\nInterestingly, autonomic failure is often associated with the side effects of drugs being taken for treating other disorders, par- ticularly those pharmacological agents that interfere with normal chemical neurotransmission within autonomic pathways. So, for example, treating recumbent hypertension in the elderly using antihypertensive drugs, which interfere with adrenergic mecha- nisms in the sympathetic nervous system, may result in more serious complications of hypotension and dizziness when the person stands up. Another common example is the experience of dry-mouth and urinary retention associated with antidepressant medication.",

The sympathetic nervous system is critical for maintaining blood pressure as we move from the horizontal to the vertical and for this control it is an automatic reflex that constricts the blood vessels in the legs and abdomen to prevent blood rushing from our head to pool in these regions. During exercise, sympathetic activity increases the frequency and strength of heartbeats whilst also controlling sweating and blood flow to the skin to maintain a physiologically appropriate body temperature. Sympathetic influ- ences also help to maintain continence.",

However, there are some end organs, for example peripheral blood vessels, which have only a sympathetic supply.\n\nPeripheral autonomic function and its central control The peripheral ANS, comprising sympathetic and parasympa- thetic neural pathways, is primarily an efferent system innervating smooth muscle of the target visceral end organs to provide specific functions (Figure 10.1). Most organs are supplied by both of these pathways that are said to have opposing efferent and regulatory controls such as dilating or constricting the pupils or accelerating or slowing heart rate, in each case by sympathetic or parasym- pathetic activity, respectively. However, there are four end organs that have only sympathetic supply: these are peripheral blood ves- sels, sweat glands, apocrine glands, and the erector pili muscles, one exception to this being the cavernosus tissue in the penis and clitoris, which have both sympathetic and parasympathetic fibres.",

Since they provide pain sensation for the viscera, or internal organs, they are also called visceral afferents. The affer- ent pathways of autonomic reflexes can originate in individual organs but ordinarily they can have their origins anywhere, so that direct reflex interactions can take place between different organs (for example, the urinary bladder and bowel) [7] . Also, somatic and autonomic afferent pathways can interact (Table 10.1) at the segmental level to give necessary coordinated effects on the one hand or unusual referred sensations on the other. Coordinated effects, for example, are particularly important for proper func- tion of the lower urinary tract whereby if the bladder and the stri- ated urethral sphincter are not coordinated (detrusor\u2013sphincter dyssynergia) then continence and efficient emptying can be seri- ously compromised, as in the neurogenic bladder [8].",

A prominent example is the carotid sinus baroreflex. Increased blood pressure in the carotid sinus increases the discharge from afferent fibres that travel by way of the ninth cranial nerve to cardiovascular centres in the brainstem. These centres increase the activity of descending effer- ent vagal fibres that slow heart rate, while inhibiting sympathetic fibres that increase heart rate and blood vessel tone. One of the striking features of ANS function is the rapidity and intensity with which it can change visceral function. Within 3 to 5 seconds, it can increase heart rate to about twice its resting level. Bronchial smooth muscle tone is largely controlled by way of parasympa- thetic fibres carried in the vagus nerve. These nerves produce mild to moderate constriction of the bronchioles.",

It usually is pre- ceded by sweating, pallor, blurred vision, dizziness, and nausea. Fainting may have an abrupt onset, with an initial increase in sympathetic activity leading to increased heart rate and vascular resistance. The initial sympathetic response is brief and followed by a sudden drop in heart rate, a decrease in vascular resistance, a profound fall in blood pressure and cerebral blood flow, and loss of consciousness. Fainting is more common in people who are in the upright position, and resumption of the supine position dur- ing a faint usually results in a return of consciousness. Factors that predispose to fainting include a reduction in venous return to the heart resulting from orthostatic or postural stress, blood loss, or an increased intrathoracic pressure because of performance of the Valsalva manoeuvre. The risk of syncope is increased in a hot environment because of vasodilatation and loss of extracellular fluid volume caused by sweating. Emotional fainting can occur as the result of reduced vasoconstrictor outflow and increased vasodilator outflow from CNS centres that influence blood vessel tone. Most healthy people can precipitate presyncopal conditions, particularly in hot weather, when they hyperventilate and produce cerebral vasoconstriction secondary to decreased cerebral carbon dioxide levels. Assumption of the standing position or standing without moving the legs to promote venous return contributes to the presyncopal condition.

Consequently, the consumption of a meal that is high in carbohydrate content, with the subsequent release of insulin, has the potential for producing a postprandial decrease in blood pressure. This aspect of autonomic function has many practical implications for people who already have disorders of ANS function, such as elderly people and people who have had a stroke. Several studies have shown a significant reduction of post- prandial blood pressure in elderly people. In people who have had a stroke, autoregulation of the cerebral vessels in the affected area",

    "text": "Control of the lower urinary tract Coordinated function of the urinary bladder and its sphincters depends on the complete integrity of central and peripheral ner- vous pathways in a complex neural control system located in the brain, spinal cord and somato-visceral nerves [13] involving sym- pathetic, parasympathetic and somatic interactions (Figure 10.6). Micturition, or \u2018urination\u2019, occurs involuntarily in infants and young children until the age of 3 to 5 years, after which it is regu- lated voluntarily. The neural circuitry that controls this process is complex and highly distributed: it involves pathways at many lev- els of the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system and is mediated by multiple neurotransmitter systems. Diseases or inju- ries of the nervous system in adults can cause the re-emergence of involuntary or reflex micturition, leading to urinary incontinence. This is a major health problem, especially in those with neurological impairment. The neural control of micturition and how disruption of this control leads to abnormal storage and release of urine is essential to address the issues of diagnosis and treatment [14].",

    "text": "The control system for micturition is believed to act like a switching circuit in the pontine region of the brain to maintain a reciprocal and coordinated relationship between the reservoir function of the bladder and sphincteric outlet function of the urethra [15]. As the bladder slowly fills, any tendency for spon- taneous contractions of the detrusor smooth muscle in the blad- der wall are inhibited, while urethral smooth and striated muscle sphincters are contracted to prevent leakage. Furthermore, vol- untary control of the striated urethral sphincter and pelvic floor muscles are also an essential part of the continence mechanism. Voiding requires a complete relaxation of the sphincters, coupled with a coordinated sustained detrusor contraction so that urine is expelled quickly and efficiently from the bladder. This syner- gistic relationship between the smooth muscle of the bladder wall and the sphincters around the urethra is essential for maintain- ing continence on the one hand and unobstructed voiding on the other [16] (Figure 10.7A).",

Anal sphincter tone can be quantified by anorectal manometry. The anorectal sensory response, anorectal reflexes, rectal compliance, and defecatory function are also assessed by anorectalmanometry. Anal sphincter function is assessed by measurement of resting sphincter pressure, squeeze sphincter pressure, and the functional length of the anal canal. Changes in anal and rectal pressures during attempted defecation are also assessed, particularly useful in the diagnosis of dyssyner- gic or obstructive defecation, a common cause of constipation. Assessment of rectal sensation is useful in patients with faecal incontinence or rectal hyposensitivity. The presence or absence of the rectoanal contractile reflex and the rectoanal inhibitory reflex is also documented. Rectal compliance is calculated and reflects the capacity and distensibility of the rectum. Rectal compliance is calculated by plotting the relationship between balloon volume (dV) and steady state intrarectal pressure (dP). The balloon expulsion test is used to assess rectoanal co-ordination during defecatory manoeuvres. The test evalu- ates a patient\u2019s ability to expel a filled balloon from the rectum, providing a simple and more physiologic assessment of defeca- tion dynamics [22].",

Body temperature is under direct autonomic control via hypotha- lamic regulation. Peripheral cold and warm receptors project to the hypothalamus via the spinal cord, although deep tempera- ture sensors are also present. When core temperature decreases, sympathetic (noradrenergic) mechanisms induce piloerection, shivering, and vasoconstriction to produce body heat and shunt blood away from the cool surface. Areas lacking connection between the hypothalamus and the sympathetic system do not mount this response. Given a large enough surface area lacking these mechanisms, core temperature will decline. In practical terms, individuals with lesions at T6 and above exhibit the prob- lem, since a loss of descending sympathetic control of more than half of the body is present [41]. Management relies on awareness, prevention then correcting the temperature as much as possible. One of the best ways for a person with a SCI to cool down is to have a cold wet towel wrapped around the back of the neck. The skin could also be damped down or sprayed with cool water to allow water to evaporate from the skin, and cool the body. If a person gets too cold, then layers of clothing and warm fluids can bring the core temperature back up to normal. Occasionally warmed, humidified oxygen, heated intravenous saline, warmed blankets or heat lamps will be required although care must be taken on insensate skin.",

In turn, these mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in secondary brain injury after stroke [79].\n\nAutonomic shift to sympathetic overactivity has been repeatedly observed in acute stroke. Sykora et al. [84] again hypothesize that hyperglycemia in acute stroke relates to autonomic imbalance and that the adverse effects on stroke outcome may be cross-linked. They observed an association between hyperglycaemia and decreased baroreceptor sensitivity in non-diabetic patients, suggesting that hyperglycaemic reaction in acute stroke may reflect stroke-related autonomic changes and suggest outcome effects of autonomic changes and hyperglycaemia are interdependent, having the sym- pathovagal imbalance as a common underlying mechanism.

Recent functional imaging studies have, for example, helped us to identify brain and spinal cord structures that are con- cerned with particular vegatative functions including the control of cardiovascular arousal mechanisms [95] and more recently, central control of the bladder [96].\n\nCNS areas that exert particular autonomic control, including central as well as peripheral pathways may then become the targets for various interventions including smart drugs and devices. An example of the latter is the use of conditional neuro-stimulators which only apply their stimulation when abnormal activity such as neurogenic bladder overactivity (detrusor hyper-reflexia) is detected and then suppressed (conditional neuromodulation) [97]. In medical therapies there are bound to be much further advances in pharmacological agents that can more precisely tar- get specific organs and their autonomic nervous control to effect benefit. Medical device delivery of drugs that are now widely used in spasticity control (e.g. baclofen pumps) are now being adapted to deliver drugs for long-term pain management [98] and the potential for targeted delivery in other areas of the central ner- vous system are possible, including those controlling autonomic function. Furthermore, these types of drugs may work better in combination with other therapies involving implantable neuro- stimulators which could be used to promote drug action by stimu- lating the autonomic pathways in the targeted areas.",

    "text": "Finally, there is the exciting development of possible biological solutions to neuroprotection, neural repair and neuroregeneration of central and peripheral pathways following disease or trauma. In spinal cord injury, for instance, the biological approach to restor- ing lost function is often termed \u2018the cure\u2019 and although there have been significant experimental advances made over approximately the last three decades, mainly in the field of restoring locomotor function, the so-called \u2018cure\u2019 remains elusive. This is especially true for autonomic dysfunction where only recently have scien- tists begun to take a broader interest in these aspects of experi- mental scientific research in spinal cord injury [105]. It remains to be seen how much of this translates generally into developing newer techniques in neurorehabilitation.",

With respect to clinical translation, this multidimensional con- ceptualization of functional recovery discloses the difficulties and limitations of animal research. While animal models are certainly suitable to investigate elementary concepts of pathophysiologi- cal recovery mechanisms at the somatic level (cellular/subcellu- lar, basic behavioural analyses), other intra- and extra-individual dimensions, as previously described, can hardly be mimicked. For example, the level of somatic functions by applying the National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) or the assessment of activities of daily living (ADL) and mobility, reflected by the Barthel ADL Index in the stroke setting cannot be replicated in small animals.",

These approaches aim at the stimula- tion of injured axon pathways to reconnect CNS regions rostral and caudal to the injury site. Destroyed CNS tissue is replaced by factor-, cell- or biomaterial-based interventions [7, 8]. In SCI this approach was spurred by early studies showing that the failure of injured mammalian CNS axons to regrow in the adult can be over- come by introducing an axon growth conducive environment into the injured spinal cord [9] . In subsequent years many preclinical strategies were developed, which were reported to promote struc- tural and functional recovery mostly in spinal cord injured small animals. Paralleling translational efforts in ischaemic stroke, all of those studies, be it factor- or cell-based, failed to demonstrate efficacy in human SCI (for review see [10, 11]).",

In other words, we want to iden- tify either individual factors of the respective disease responsible for the poor translational success or more general problems of similar neurological disease entities, which prevent prediction of therapeutic efficacy in human individuals. To achieve this, aspects influencing the predictive value of preclinical models in stroke and SCI will be analysed in this chapter: (1) the choice of animal species including preferred gender and age; (2) the disease mimicking intervention, (3) the consideration of standard thera- pies within preclinical models; (3) the accurarcy in translating preclinically assessed therapies into the clinical trial; and (4) the coherence of structural and functional outcome parameters in preclinical models and disease.",

In SCI, spinal cord dimensions (human spinal cord including the lesion area is at least 10 times larger than rat spinal cord) demand the use of an animal species, which at least approaches the dimensions of the human spinal cord. Until now there are only very few examples of large animal studies, which were translated into a clinical trial. The neuropro- tective agent NXY-059 was investigated in a primate middle cere- bral artery occlusion (MCAO) model [15] and was investigated in a clinical trial, which again failed to demonstrate efficacy of the drug [16, 17]. An antibody against the myelin component Nogo was reported to be effective in a monkey lateral cervical spinal cord hemisection model [18], which eventually served as the basis for a first in man open-label multicentre clinical study.

Animal age Stroke is a disease of the elderly population. Cofactors pronounced in the elderly population such as multimorbidity and impaired translation of neurological recovery into function tremendously influence the outcome [23]. In contrast, most experimental stroke models do not sufficiently account for age. Even more, mainly young inbred healthy male animals without comorbidities are preferably investigated (Table 11.1). Rodent models for aged ani- mals or animals with other relevant cardiovascular risk factors like hypertension exist, however, they did not provide the preclin- ical basis for translation into the clinic so far [24].",

While epidemiological data suggest that stroke is a relatively bal- anced disorder in terms of gender distribution (28), male animal models are usually employed in preclinical studies (Table 11.1). It is known that important pathophysiological processes vary depending on the gender. For example, the infarct size in female mice is smaller than in males [29], which additionally illustrates potential gender biases.\n\nIn SCI, the predominant gender is the complete opposite pre- clinically and clinically. In animal models female rodents are pre- ferred, since manual bladder emptying in females is facilitated due to obvious neuroanatomical advantages (Table 11.1). Clinically, many more male individuals suffer from traumatic SCI with a male to female ratio of up to 6.7:1 [26]. The female rodent prefer- ence might lead to false positive functional outcome assessments, since female rats have been shown superior spontaneous recovery following spinal cord contusion compared to male rats [30].",

Therefore, the com- parability of interventional effects between identical stroke mod- els but different small animal strains is limited (Table 11.1).\n\nIn small animal SCI models substantial differences have been reported in terms of morphological changes at the lesion site. Mice lack cystic cavity formation at the lesion site [34, 35], whereas rats\u2014paralleling pathological findings in primates and human subjects\u2014develop typical cystic lesion defects. Such spe- cies differences can have profound implications.

Over many years, it was proposed but never demonstrated that regenerative approaches aim for reinnervation of target neurons, which requires both long-distance axon regeneration and proper target recognition. Therefore, a highly artificial rat cervical lesion model was established, where the dorsal columns containing the ascending proprioceptive projections were transected close to the target neuron area in the medulla oblongata\u2014the nucleus cunea- tus. Indeed, combined cellular transplantation and neurotrophin overexpression promoted axon regrowth across the lesion site and proper target reinnervation [55], including recovery of func- tion [56].

Timing of therapeutic intervention in relation to the lesion time point represents a highly relevant issue in the translation of a given therapeutic intervention.\n\nTiming of therapeutic intervention Neuroprotective therapies in ischaemic stroke target early patho- physiological events (excitotoxicity, inflammatory changes, neural apoptosis, free radicals, calcium influx). Therefore, short intervals between disease onset and drug administration are considered to be critical in neuroprotective therapies following the theme \u2018time is brain\u2019. In preclinical studies, this prerequisite has been met (Table 11.2). However, clinical studies investigating the efficacy of neuroprotective agents following cerebral ischaemia, frequently struggle with the timely drug administration. For example, the free radical scavenging drug NXY-059 was applied within 4 hours after stroke onset [106], whereas respective clinical trials allowed to administer the drug within a 6 hour time frame [16, 17]. Preclinical and clinical assessment of another free radical scav- enger\u2014Tirilazid\u2014yielded even more pronounced differences with respect to treatment delay (10 minutes in preclinical experiments versus 5 hours in the clinical trial) [107].",

In case of specific antibodies aiming to eliminate axon growth inhibitory effects of the myelin-associated protein Nogo, the differential treat- ment delay in preclinical versus clinical studies was even more pronounced. Preclinical studies investigated structural and functional effects of respective antibodies only resulting from drug administration immediately post SCI [109]. In the clinical trial, antibodies were then applied in a time frame up to 28 days post injury [110]. Looking at logistically challenging cell-based regenerative studies the maintainance of a proper treatment interval is even more difficult. An ongoing clinical trial inves- tigates allogenic fetal derived neural stem cells in the subacute phase of SCI between 3 months and 1 year after injury [111]. In contrast, respective preclinical studies administered the cells 9 days after contusion SCI in mice [112]. Applying autologous cell transplantation based therapies represents the most difficult strategy in terms of timely therapeutic intervention. Cells need to be harvested from patients\u2019 tissue samples, isolated and prop- agated in culture to be transplanted back into the patient. Most preclinical studies aiming at autologous transplantation mimic this rather complex cell preparation procedure by substituting syngenic cells.

Several histopatho- logical methods exist to analyse axonal regrowth and sprouting after experimental SCI. Axons can be visualized and quantified via immunohistochemistry, anterograde and retrograde tracing of motor, sensory and autonomic pathways [133\u2013136]. However, as already mentioned, axon regrowth does not necessarily mean re-establishment of neuronal connections, which have been inter- rupted. Few studies actually show reinnervation of previous neu- ronal targets [55, 56]. Furthermore, myelination and the status of oligodendroglial survival/replacement can be assessed ultras- tructurally [137\u2013139]. Of course, such a structural post mortem assessement is not applicable to clinical trials. Here, non-inva- sive visualization of the human spinal cord is exclusively based on MRI, which can also be employed for in vivo small animal imaging [140, 141]. MRI technology has advanced tremendously within the last decade and it is in principle capable of detecting changes related to axon integrity (diffusion tensor imaging) and myelination status (magnetization transfer ratio). However, these sequences cannot yet be applied to the spinal cord, where sur- rounding bone structures, metal artefacts resulting from spine stabilization and respiration associated motion artefacts impede specific structural analysis. As in ischaemic stroke, MRI can visualize the lesion size in both experimental and human SCI. In general, the correlation between the lesion size detected with MRI and functional outcome is rather poor [142, 143].

Main problems of the tests are the lacking rater-objectivity and the nonlinear/discrete distribution of the test results. Moreover, there is no clear consensus on how much difference in the BBB score from baseline is a meaningful change with respect to clinical translation. Thus, there is a need for more objective functional tests with transferability or rather compara- bility to the clinical setting [165\u2013167].

    "text": "Since the majority of clinical spinal cord injuries are located at cervical level with consecutive upper extremity dysfunction, cor- responding functional assessment of forelimb function in respec- tive animal models represents a challenging task. Effects on fine motor skills are modest and hard to assess in rodents and there- fore of limited sensitivity regarding the translation into the clini- cal setting [142, 174]. Generally used assessments in animals are gross sensorimotor skill tests like the \u2018forelimb reaching task\u2019, meanwhile refined by differentiated video motion analysis to identify compensatory movements of spinal cord injured rat [175\u2013 179]. Skilled forelimb reaching is also reflected by the \u2018Montoya Staircase Test\u2019 and the \u2018Cylinder Rearing Test\u2019, which have been used in several models of CNS diseases including SCI [72, 180, 181]. Whether non-human primate models suffice to close the translational gap remains to be evaluated [22].",

Even so, the translatability of preclinical neuro- physiological findings into the clinical setting has not been dem- onstrated yet.\n\nSummary and conclusion With the use of preclinical models, substantial knowledge about fundamental CNS disease mechanisms (degeneration, regenera- tion, inflammation) and potential modes of action of treatments has been gathered for spinal cord injury and ischaemic stroke over the past decades. Nevertheless, the output in terms of suc- cessful clinical translation of promising preclinical research results is poor [4, 11,188\u2013193]. And this is despite joined efforts in both diseases to define the most important criteria, which have to be considered in order to substantially increase the like- lihood that a given preclinical therapy will successfully trans- late into a clinically approved treatment. Already 10 years ago, first recommendations based on meta-analysis of existing pre- clinical studies\u2014so called Stroke Treatment Academic Industry Roundtable (STAIR)\u2014were presented in ischaemic stroke. [14, 19]. In SCI, guidelines for the conduct of clinical trials have also been established [159, 186, 194, 195]. In terms of preclinical stud- ies, a survey in the scientific community investigating the most relevant factors of preclinical studies and recommendations for the optimal conduct of preclinical experiments has recently been published [196].",

Regarding the investigation of neuroprotective therapies in ischaemic stroke, particular concerns are focusing on the choice of structural outcome parameters. Most preclinical studies report successful neuroprotection as soon as a reduction of the infarct volume (determined by histology or MRI) is detected. However, this approach is rather crude, since neuroprotective interventions primarily aim to protect neurons and not the entire neuropil. Moreover, in due consideration of neuroanatomic aspects, it cannot be translated one to one into a correspond- ing structural analysis in human subjects. In SCI, in recent years more and more efforts have been made to detect mechanisms of given neuroregenerative approaches such as reinnervation, which are likely to account for functional recovery [55, 56].",

    "text": "2. Compared to SCI, the discrepancy in terms of average animal age and average age of patients is much more apparent in stroke.\n\n3. The ischaemic territory (middle cerebral territory) is rather uniform throughout the majority of preclinical studies. In SCI, a wider variety of lesion levels (cervical or thoracic) and severity (incomplete versus complete) are available in the experimental setting.\n\nDisease-specific pitfalls in SCI\n\n1. Potential pitfalls particularly relevant for SCI concern the animal size in the context of axon regeneration. Axons have to regrow over much longer distances in humans to promote reinnervation compared to small animals. In neuroprotective therapies in stroke the issue of animal size is less relevant.\n\n2. Another issue in SCI relates to the timing of the therapeutic intervention. Neuroprotective therapies in stroke models are applied immediately after induction of the ischaemia. Likewise in humans, the goal is to initiate the respective therapy within an early time window after the ischaemia. In neuroregenera- tive approaches for SCI, timing is still less stringent in both animal models and clinical trials. In most regenerative therapy approaches, the application of the drug, cell or biomaterial fre- quently needs time (surgery required, cells need to be delivered/ prepared). Furthermore, it is not precisely known, which time point of intervention in animal studies translates into corre- sponding time points in humans.",

This is understandable considering ethical issues, financial restrictions and large animal numbers that are needed to get statistically relevant results.\n\nTaken together, issues inherent to disease models, as well as higher-level pitfalls independent from the disease model, sup- port the notion that animals fail to closely reflect the respective human disease entities stroke and SCI. Even if these factors were identified, they could not always be addressed in the preclinical setting. Therefore, preclinical models can at best provide proof of principle that a neuroprotective or neuroregenerative therapy will be effective. Specific attention should be paid to the detec- tion of underlying structural mechanisms of recovery and robust and reproducible functional improvement in respective animal models. A provocative conclusion would be to proceed from the culture dish straight to the patient, employing animal models only for safety and pharmacokinetic analysis. However, this is not a realistic approach, which would find acceptance within the basic and clinical science community. As mentioned, there is still significant room for improvement.

In neu- rorehabilitation, mechanistic insights were achieved through the advancement of the neurosciences and have provided mechanis- tic explanations for some therapeutic approaches that originated from experience\u2014\u2018post-hoc\u2019 so to say. Still, much is unknown.\n\nAnimal models complement the study of human physiology because they allow for the use of methodologies that cannot be used in humans. Differences in anatomy and physiology between humans and animals, however, limit the interpretability and applicability for human medicine. Since most of these methods are invasive, ethical questions need to be looked at carefully. Knowledge gains must potentially be substantial to justify the use of animals. In rehabilitation and recovery sciences, so little is known about the brain\u2019s potential for recovery and the best ways to exploit this potential that animal experiments are necessary.",

    "text": "Why animal models In the past, experience and observation served as a basis for the development of neurorehabilitation therapies. While this is certainly a valuable strategy, it falls short of the translational approach in which a physiological mechanism provides the idea of a therapeutic intervention and serves as a surrogate marker for its optimization. Constraint-induced movement therapy was devel- oped based on monkey experiments showing that the non-use of a deafferentiated limb can be reversed by restricting the movement of, that is, immobilizing, the intact limb [1] . Deeper insights into the neurophysiology can only be reached by using animal models. Animal models are also needed to test invasive interventions such as drugs [e.g. 2] or brain stimulation especially invasive brain stimulation [e.g. 3]. Such methods have not yet entered the clinical routine of stroke rehabilitation but are effective treat- ment approaches in extrapyramidal movement disorders such as Parkinson\u2019s disease or tremor. Without the evidence from animal experimentation would human use be difficult to ethically justify. Animal models carry a decisive advantage, that is, their homo- geneity. The optimal model has the least interindividual variabil- ity that is related to methodology, for example, to the size of the brain lesion or the genetic background of the animals. This homo- geneity allows to detect effects of interventions that are rather small and that would require large human samples and lengthy",

This methodological advantage of ani- mal models may help to identify drug side effects on neuroplas- ticity\u2014that is drugs that reduce or interfere with learning and recovery processes. Stroke patients receive a multitude of medi- cations against seizures, depression, hypertension, agitation etc. Some of these drugs\u2014based on their pharmacological action\u2014 potentially reduce neural plasticity, as it may be the case for the antiepileptic levetiracetam [4] . If these drugs had dramatic effects of recovery, their detrimental action would probably have been noticed clinically. More likely, however, these effects are small and may add up to explain why some patients recover better then oth- ers. Such small effect sizes are easier to detect in animal models of neuroplasticity that use a surrogate marker instead of behavioural recovery as their outcome measure.",

Considering that pre-existing knowledge of a task influences its recovery [13], the fact that most movements that serve as a measure for recovery are new to the rat while humans aim to recover motor tasks that they had performed thousands of times before, can limit rat-to- human comparability.\n\nOne more difficulty in rodent models of stroke recovery is related to the ischaemia model itself.\n\nModels of experimental brain injury Several methods exist for inducing ischaemia in the brain of mice or rats and each has its own advantages and disadvantages [14] (Table 12.1). Most models involve cortical or cortical+subcortical strokes. Occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCAO) by using a filament inserted through the internal carotid artery, ligating the artery or injecting embolic materials is commonly used. MCAO-induced lesions vary in size [14]. Other models like photothrombosis (Figure 12.1) or intra- or epicortical injec- tions of endothelin-1, a vasoconstrictor that produces reversible ischaemia for up to 3 hours, produce more homogeneous lesions, but are pathophysiologically distinct from human stroke. A sub- stantial proportion of strokes in human affect solely subcortical white matter and/or basal ganglia\u2014the typical lacunar strokes. Rodent models of subcortical stroke use stereotactic injections of endothelin-1 into the internal capsule [15] or into the subcortical white matter [16].",

Some animals simply alter their motor strategy after a stroke coping with a deficit to reach as many pel- lets as before.

Some rather subtle adjustments in how different network prop- erties can be modulated to dramatically improve motor func- tion after paralysis have been identified when these principles are merged into a comprehensive synergistic strategy. These principles also suggest that a paradigm shift in present-day concepts regard- ing the neural control of movement should be considered. More specifically, those properties that are of fundamental importance in achieving functional recovery as demonstrated in several ani- mal models of spinal cord injury include the following: (1) exten- sive plasticity among the spinal networks can persist for prolonged periods after an injury; (2) an important component of this plasti- city is that the spinal networks can learn a motor task and it learns what is practiced\u2014a clear example of activity-dependent plasti- city; (3) relatively non-specific signals projecting into the spinal networks can trigger very complex motor behaviours, including postural regulation and stepping at different loads, speeds, and even directions; (4) those signals triggering such complex behav- iours can be generated or facilitated by different modes of electrical stimulation and by pharmacological modulation; and (5) sensory information (e.g. proprioceptive and cutaneous inputs), can serve as the controller in generating relatively fine and complex motor tasks in the absence of any",

For example, the application of electrical, pharmacological, and/or sensory stimu- lation can induce locomotor-like movements, even after a severe spinal cord injury.

Only recently, however, has it been clearly demonstrated that the pattern of dynamic sensory input can provide an ensemble of information from multiple sensory receptors to inform the spinal networks of what mechanical events have just occurred (\u2018feedback\u2019) and what is expected to occur subsequently (\u2018feedforward\u2019). Thus the key concept underlying the ability to realize significant improvement in motor function after paralysis is that the spinal networks can be neuromodulated using a range of interventions such that the spinal circuitry becomes enabled to generate complex movements using intrinsic control mechanisms as long as the physiological state of the spinal networks remain within a critical range of excit- ability [23, 24].",

First, it only has been recently fully recognized that the spinal circuitry itself, without any assis- tance from input from the brain, has the capability to serve as the sole source of control of a wide variety of motor tasks that can be performed by the hindlimbs when the spinal cord circuitry is sufficiently neuromodulated to an appropriate level of excitabil- ity.

They demonstrated that tonic stimulation of selected areas of the brainstem, now known as the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR), in an acutely decerebrated cat could induce stepping on a treadmill belt over a range of speeds. Details of the characteristics of the stepping were a function of the precise site of stimulation, the intensity of stimu- lation, and the sensory information from the hindlimbs. One of the major points from these studies is that a simple tonic stimu- lus can induce a complex motor behaviour (stepping). These data",

Subsequently, Grillner and Zangger [26] demonstrated that the functionally isolated lumbosacral circuitry of a mammal could generate rhythmic, coordinated output of flexor and extensor motor nerves for hours. This was shown in adult, acutely spinalized cats with the hindlimbs functionally deafferented (curarized) and by providing a pharmacological stimulus (L-dopa and nialimide) presented systemically. Immediately following these experiments Edgerton and colleagues [27] performed the first series of experi- ments designed to begin to determine the interneuronal basis of this complex locomotor rhythmicity. These experiments dem- onstrated that interneurons throughout the dorsal, middle, and ventral laminae of the grey matter of the lumbosacral spinal cord were active in a precise and consistent rhythmic pattern, with each interneuron having a unique on/off and frequency modulation. The main result from these experiments was that there was an expansive network of neurons that participate in \u2018fictive locomo- tion\u2019 in a large mammal even in the absence of any sensory input. Since that time hundreds of experiments have been performed in attempts to determine the mechanisms of the underlying motor rhythms generated by the spinal cord in mammals commonly known as central pattern generation [16, 28\u201333].",

    "text": "While our understanding of some of the basic mechanisms of central pattern generation has advanced considerably, there has been relatively little progress in understanding how this network of neurons that can generate this motor rhythmicity also can pro- cess infinite complex patterns of sensory information associated with posture and locomotion [20, 34, 35]. Furthermore, the ability to translate important observations derived from central pattern generation experiments to humans has been relatively slow. This limitation largely has been associated with the inability to per- form the necessary critical experiments under in vivo conditions in adult mammals. An objective of the present chapter is to sum- marize some of the new approaches that have made it possible to partially overcome some of these limitations from the perspective of studying adult systems in vivo with the possibility of translating the findings to human subjects with severe paralysis due to spinal cord injury. To give some insight as to the progress to date we are presenting examples of several types of experimental interven- tions that show promise toward translation in developing reha- bilitative procedures to facilitate recovery of motor and autonomic function after a spinal cord injury in human subjects.",

To re-engage these circuits after prolonged periods of paralysis one or more neuromodulatory interven- tions are needed to achieve an enabling physiological state. As noted earlier the ability to use stimulation (electrically and/ or pharmacologically) of the spinal cord circuitry to induce stepping has been known for decades. Less attention has been given to the control of posture and even less to the importance of the spinal cord circuitry in the control of voluntary move- ment. Initial evidence for enabling was reflected in experiments where sensory input was observed to vary the motor response to brainstem stimulation [25]. This idea, however, remained submerged for decades with a primary focus on inducing step- ping via spinal cord epidural stimulation and stimulation of the mesencephalic locomotor region.

Sensory input can reach the crucial interneurons that actually control posture and locomotion dynamically from millisecond to millisecond. The higher the level of stimulation above the motor threshold, the greater the motor response is. The conse- quences of a larger motor response is that it is inversely related to the ability to capitalize on the potential for sensory control\u2014 that is the ability to have an enabling or facilitating effect as opposed to an inducing effect leaving the sensory system with no \u2018say-so\u2019 as to what the motor response will be. Although the difference in the source and level of stimulation is a nonfactor by design in studies of central pattern generation, experiments that integrate sensory input into a central pattern generation similar to that occurring under in vivo conditions seems almost necessary to effectively translate these basic biological con- cepts to enabling motor control of multiple motor tasks after a severe spinal cord injury in animal models and now in humans. Inducing activity to enable or facilitate movement by engaging the multiple mechanical receptors associated with limb move- ment, as well as engaging the seemingly little residual descend- ing motor projections below the lesion that may be greater than generally recognized, provides a newly realized strategy for suc- cessful rehabilitation [19, 39\u201343].",

As the concept of cen- tral pattern generation became so dominant the other capabili- ties of this circuitry has largely been unexplored. It is gradually becoming clearer that it is not only, or even primarily, the ability of the central pattern generator to induce alternating flexion and extension in a rhythmic manner that is important, but its abil- ity to interpret complex sensory ensembles from multiple recep- tors located throughout the hindlimbs in real time [43, 51]. This interpretation includes the ability to make appropriate decisions to activate and inhibit those networks within the spinal cord that generate well-coordinated movements and correct responses to perturbations.",

Until recently there was no strong evidence that the lumbosacral circuitry had any ability to sustain equilibrium and balance during posture or locomotion. We have performed a series of experiments over the last few years that demonstrate very clearly that decere- brated cats have the ability to generate useful corrective responses that help to maintain posture and to maintain the position of the hindquarters in a state of equilibrium during full weight-bearing locomotion when the lumbosacral spinal cord is receiving eEmc at the segments (Figure 13.5). Even when the hindlimbs collapse when stepping on a treadmill belt (Figure 13.5A), the hindquar- ters can regain full weight-bearing stepping and sustain sufficient equilibrium of the hindquarters so that stepping can be sustained over a period of minutes [52]. Although these data cannot exclude sources of control involving the brainstem given that the animals were decerebrated and not spinalized, more recent data demon- strate qualitatively similar but less robust responses in chronic spinal cats (Musienko et al., unpublished observations). In addi- tion it has been reported that chronic spinal cats can learn to stand without assistance for up to 20 minutes [13].",

The thoracolumbar cord produces sympathetic innervation, while the sacral cord produces parasympathetic and somatic innervation. A spinal cord injury above the lumbosacral cord disrupts control of voiding via central, volitional inputs. It also alters the status of micturition centres in the cord that initially produce an areflexic bladder with urinary retention. After a period of recovery, there is development of auto- matic/reflexive micturition and neurogenic detrusor overactivity mediated by spinal micturition circuits [57].

In this model, neurogenic detru- sor overactivity mediated by heightened C-fibre activity has been observed. Clinical evidence suggests this mechanism also may exist in humans. Therapies to improve bladder function may have to re-set C-fibre tone to a pre-injury level. In rats, post-injury neu- roplasticity has been associated with nerve growth factor (NGF) in the bladder and spinal cord [58\u201360]. Additional neuromodulatory factors TRPV1 [61], P2X3 [61] and/or the sensory neuropeptides substance P and calcitonin-gene-related peptide [62], may play a role in the transition from areflexia and retention shortly after injury to automatic/reflexive voiding in chronic injury. An under- standing of how these established signaling systems could be used to mediate improvements in bladder function with neuromodu- latory interventions may be a productive approach in regaining some bladder control [19, 53, 63]. Although there are a variety of stimulation techniques that are in current use to regain some improvement in bladder function, they almost all involve some surgical procedures, such as denervation of selected nerves and/ or dorsal roots. The existing devices produce a subset of the mic- turition behaviour but do not result in enduring plastic changes to the circuitry that allow patients to become device independent. Peripheral nerve stimulators have been used with variable success. For example, the Finetech\u2013Brindley posterior/anterior stimulator often is accompanied by dorsal root rhizotomy.

These axons then must function- ally reconnect to those interneurons and motoneurons that con- trol the coordination among those motor pools, performing an infinite number of movements differing from millisecond to mil- lisecond kinetically and kinematically.

There is considerable experimental evidence consistent with an alternative reparative strategy that seems to be more feasible. This repair strategy consists of establish- ing new interconnections in the region of the injury when some supraspinal\u2013spinal connectivity remains. This condition seems to exist in many human patients, even when clinical assessments indicate complete paralysis [85\u201387]. If a critical level of new func- tional interconnections at the point of injury persists even when there is a severe impairment, perhaps this residual connectivity combined with the formation of new functional synaptic connec- tions can provide a greater level of intrasegmental and interseg- mental connectivity to the more or less intact residual networks distal to the lesion. It seems that supraspinal input can trigger highly functional motor tasks if proprioception and cutaneous sensory input from the limbs can be engaged to control the details necessary to achieve meaningful movements. Experimental mod- els supporting this conceptual framework have been derived from the insight gained from central pattern generation experiments [28], and in vivo experiments in which animals regain significant locomotor function after transection of some corticospinal path- ways that reach a functional target directly or indirectly via the brainstem [5, 88].",

Within a matter of days or weeks of training for a spe- cific motor task with eEmc for about 1 hour per day these indi- viduals have recovered significant levels of control of movement with regard to the timing of the effort, rate of force developed, and the level of force that can be generated at individual joints. When individuals with motor incomplete, but severe, paralysis are given instructions to move a specific joint, there often is a mass action simultaneous response of flexor and extensors of both legs, indicating a significant loss of the ability to activate and coordinate the desired motor pools needed to generate the intended motor event [89, 90]. The most probable explanation for the newly realized volitional function is that most of the details of the neural pathways generating the volitional demands are in the spinal circuitry. Thus, perhaps the supraspinal signals can be general as long as there is access to the fine control potential intrinsic to the spinal circuitry\u2014that is the combination of pro- prioceptive and cutaneous input is a central component of the networks underlying fine motor control.",

    "text": "Spinal circuitry reorganization The potential for reorganization of spinal circuits completely inde- pendent of supraspinal influence has been shown in numerous experimental models. This learning-related phenomenon reflects the reorganization potential for performing behaviours ranging\n\nfrom a spinal rat learning to control paw position to avoid shock to spinal cats learning to stand and step and to avoid obstacles and other mechanical perturbations during stepping [13, 14, 44\u201350]. Biochemical adaptive events associated with spinal cord injury and subsequent network reorganization associated with inhibi- tory processes after the loss of supraspinal input and its return to near normal levels after stand and step training have been reported [3, 69, 75, 91\u201393]. Several experiments have shown that the number and kind of interneurons activated during stepping are reduced in spinal animals that have been trained to step and the number of interneurons activated is indirectly related to the skill level regained in stepping after a complete spinal cord tran- section (i.e., fewer neurons are activated in the animals having the greatest skill in stepping [4, 8]).",

Each network will have experienced extensive reorganization [94]. The challenge is to provide a mechanism for these two sources of control to find new solutions, that is to acti- vate novel combinations of neurons to generate movements that may not have been within their domain in the non-injured nerv- ous system. After an injury there is a \u2018new\u2019 nervous system. Novel combinations of neurons can be engaged to generate a motor task that normally would not have occurred in the absence of an injury.",

    "text": "Outlook The content of this chapter on models of spinal cord injury has focused on a wide range of experimental strategies using princi- pally mice, rats, cats, and humans. This focus is primarily because these are the animal models that have most recently contributed to the evolution of the concepts associated with spinal cord neu- romodulation. It is fair to say that virtually all of the neuromodu- latory concepts discussed and the demonstrations of how these concepts are now being applied to humans with a severe spinal cord injury were derived almost solely from this range of animal models. The underlying biology that has led to these concepts, however, is based on studies using even a wider range of differ- ent animal models over a period of decades. Although we have not discussed any of the basic findings from the lamprey model [95], this particular early vertebrate model has served as the core of much of the ideas discussed in this chapter. Obviously loco- motion in the lamprey and humans differs substantially at the \u2018systems\u2019 level, but there are remarkable similarities at the syn- aptic, cellular, and subcellular levels, and even to some degree at the systems level that have provided the basic biological core of the more complex integrative systems in humans and other mam- mals. The concept of automaticity at its most basic level certainly can be attributed to the concept of central pattern generation, a phenomenon that occurs in multiple physiological systems and in virtually all multi-cellular organisms. As we learn more about the basic principles controlling the multiple and highly integrated systems in mammals under in vivo conditions there undoubtedly will be the emergence of experimental models focusing on",

The use of any of these animal models does not imply that the experimental results will be iden- tical in the laboratory animal being tested compared to that in human subjects. In fact, in some cases these results can be very misleading if improperly interpreted as being comparable. The view of the present authors is that progress in the development of new strategies to enhance recovery from paralysis using humans as the only experimental subjects is a far less effective strategy than using a wide range of species for testing specific basic neural control mechanisms, some of which are highly likely to result in effective translation from animal models to the human. The suc- cess of this approach is likely to become even more effective as our technology improves so that more fundamental questions can be addressed with little or minimal adverse or disruptive effects on human subjects.",

    "text": "Conclusion This chapter summarizes some of the basic experiments related to neuromodulation of the spinal circuitry using techniques that can generate immediate and/or long-term effects on mul- tiple physiological systems. This neuromodulation can be generated using several different techniques to modulate the spinal circuits electrically (e.g., applying AC currents, elec- tromagnetic), pharmacologically (e.g., using monaminergic agonists), and using specific sources of artificially imposed sensory input to the spinal cord or the sensory input gener- ated by proprioceptive and cutaneous receptors when move- ments are being generated. In effect, under normal conditions supraspinal centres, including all of the sensory systems being processed by the supraspinal centres, also are continuously modulating the spinal circuitry. This modulation of the spinal circuitry essentially determines how and when it will respond to a particular stimulus or ensemble of stimuli. It appears that the spinal circuitry can be effectively neuromodulated to improve motor function in large part because of the intrinsic automaticity of the spinal circuitry. This automaticity provides the spinal circuitries with the ability to make decisions related to the appropriate activation of selected spinal networks based on the processing of proprioceptive and cutaneous information in real time in an animal or human injured to the extent that there is no remaining supraspinal input. The challenge contin- ues to be to determine the extent to which it is possible to take advantage of this automaticity to regain motor and autonomic function after a severe injury or progressive dysfunction of the nervous system. The results reported herein provide exam- ples",

This revolu- tion stems from a better understanding of the processes underly- ing intrinsic repair, the realisation that endogenous processes such as neurogenesis still occur in the adult mammalian brain [1] , and that neurotrophic factors can be used to encourage cell survival and fibre outgrowth in diseased cells within the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, we now recognise that some cellular transplants can survive in the adult CNS and make and receive connections with functional benefits to the grafted animal. In this chapter we explore various aspects of these processes includ- ing the role of adult neurogenesis in health and disease as well as the cell-based approaches that have been used to treat a whole variety of CNS disorders but especially Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD) Huntington\u2019s disease (HD) and spinal cord injury (see Table 14.2).",

    "text": "Basic biology of stem cells Endogenous neurogenesis in the adult mammalian brain It has been a long-held concept in the neurosciences that the gen- eration of neurons tapers off with the end of embryonic develop- ment. For decades the leading opinion in the field was that the adult mammalian brain is not capable of generating new neurons throughout life due to the absence of any neurogenic, dividing cells\u2014neural stem cells (NSCs). It was assumed that the neuronal networks and circuitries in the mature CNS are too complex to allow for the maturation and integration of newborn neuronal cells. Thus, the most common strategy to ameliorate disease symptoms and promote rehabilitation in the context of neuropsy- chiatric disease was to pharmacologically treat abnormalities in transmitter networks and enhance functional plasticity within the surviving networks and brain areas. However, the concept that the adult brain loses its capacity to regenerate was challenged in the mid 1960s, when the first experiments suggested that there may be proliferating cells in the restricted areas of the adult brain that appeared to have the potential to generate new neurons [2, 3]. In these pioneering studies by Altman, Kaplan, and others, radio- actively labelled thymidine was used to visualize proliferating",

However, at this time it was technically extremely difficult to truly confirm that: (i) a cell is newborn and (ii) differentiates into a neuron. However, the idea that the adult brain may even be capable of gen- erating new neurons was fuelled by the findings that cells could be isolated and propagated in vitro that showed NSC properties meaning that these cells were able to self-renew and to generate neurons in the culture dish [4] . This technical breakthrough, lead- ing to the acceptance that neurogenesis occurs in the mammalian brain throughout life, came with the use of thymidine-analogues (such as bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) that could be visualized using antibodies in combination with techniques to label neuronal cells using confocal microscopy (e.g. [5]).",

In these two neurogenic areas, NSCs (with certain astrocytic properties) that are largely quiescent (i.e. do rarely divide) under normal conditions, give rise to more proliferative progenitors that generate new, immature neurons [7]. These new neurons mature structurally and function- ally over the course of several weeks before they integrate into the pre-existing neural circuitries in the OB and DG. Interestingly, the functional properties of young, immature neurons substantially differ from their older progeny that are generated during embry- onic development. These newborn cells are much more excitable and display a higher degree of plasticity which is believed to be the reason why the adult brain invests in the energetically demanding exercise of supporting these two neurogenic (and highly plastic) regions [7].",

Even though a number of classes of antidepres- sant drugs have been in clinical use for decades, there remains a substantial fraction of patients with therapy-resistant disease, indicating the need to (i) better understand the aetiology and neural consequences of affective disorders and (ii) develop novel treatment strategies. One of the key risk factors (besides age, see \u2018Age-associated cognitive decline\u2019) to develop affective disorders is stress, which was found to dramatically reduce neurogenesis [12]. In combination with the findings that a structural hallmark of patients suffering from depression is a reduction of hippocam- pal volume as measured by non-invasive imaging approaches, this initiated a large number of studies aiming at understanding a potential link between the onset or maintenance of affective disorders and adult hippocampal neurogenesis [9] . Strikingly, a number of antidepressants such as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs) enhance the number of neurons generated and depend at least partially on neurogenesis for their efficacy (e.g., [13]. Supporting the potential contribution of failing neurogen- esis to the depressive disease process has been the fact that many antidepressants show a latency of 2 to 4 weeks between being taken and having a therapeutic effect\u2014a time that may reflect the antidepressant-induced generation, maturation, and functional integration of newborn neurons [9].",

Interestingly, the number of neurons that are generated in the adult hippocampus (and SVZ/OB sys- tem) dramatically decreases with advancing age (without coming to a complete stop) [1, 7]. Furthermore, the number of neurons born in older age does correlate with the performance of rodents on hippocampus-dependent learning tasks [17]. Thus, it has been speculated that hippocampal neurogenesis may be a critical mediator of cognition with aging. This idea has been supported for example by imaging-based findings in humans that the first structure showing functional and structural alterations in cog- nitively challenged, aged individuals is indeed the hippocampal dentate gyrus [18]. In addition, known regulators of neurogenesis, such as running and environmental enrichment, have turned out to be effective in enhancing neurogenesis in aged rodents, which was again associated with improved performance in hippocampus-dependent learning tasks [19, 20].",

For example it has been shown that neurogenesis is dramatically enhanced in rodent models of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) [21]. Notably, not only the number of neurons generated is enhanced: epileptic activity also leads to ectopic migration of newborn granule cells into the hilar region of the dentate gyrus and the aberrant formation of hilar basal dendrites that form ectopic synapses and potentially impair proper synaptic transmission and connectivity within the dentate circuitry [22, 23]. Strikingly, it has also been shown that ectopic neurogenesis is sufficient to drive epileptogenesis, further sup- porting the findings that enhanced, but massively altered neuro- genesis in the context of TLE, is potentially a contributing disease factor [24]. However, neurogenesis may not only be involved in the establishment of epileptogenic circuitries as it has also been shown that in more advanced or chronic disease stages, neuro- genesis is strongly downregulated and may represent one factor responsible for cognitive decline that is commonly observed in patients affected by chronic or therapy refractory forms of TLE [25].

First, that any pathology seen in neurons so derived after a few days or weeks in culture is disease relevant and speaks to the pathology seen in the CNS of the patient that has taken decades to develop. Second, it assumes that the disease process is cell autonomous, as the only cells being studied are the neurons so generated, and it does not, and cannot, interrogate how different cellular players may talk to each other in the disease process (e.g. the role of inflammation). Third, the reprogramming of the cells may remove some of the age-related factors that are critical in the development of PD, given this is the biggest risk factor for PD. Finally, it has to be shown that the neu- rons so produced are truly authentic neurons of the type wanted. This is especially true for dopaminergic neurons as there are at least 10 subtypes of dopaminergic neurons in the adult brain (A8\u2013 A17) [37], all of which show specific electrophysiological, neuro- chemical, and transcriptional profiles and only some of which are lost in PD [38].",

However, concerns remain with respect to their safety, mainly due to their proliferative, tumorigenic potential [42]. To overcome this issue, several groups have developed methods that allow direct conversion of human differentiated somatic cells, such as fibroblasts, into functional neurons avoiding any interme- diate pluripotent state. The first study to do this converted mouse embryonic and postnatal fibroblasts into functional neurons by the overexpression of three transcription factors (Ascl1, Brn2, and Mytl1) [43]. Subsequently, human fibroblasts have also been suc- cessfully converted into functional neurons by overexpressing the same transcription factors [44] and this has now also been done in",

For PD, obviously making dopaminergic neurons would be of interest and it has been shown that the addition of two transcription factors specific to the dopaminergic lineage (Lmx1a and FoxA2), along with the three original factors, is sufficient to generate dopaminer- gic-like neurons [44, 46]. However, the gene expression profiles of these reprogrammed DA neurons differed significantly from pri- mary midbrain DA neurons in these studies and so more recent attempts to generate iDA-like midbrain dopaminergic neurons have used six reprogramming factors (Ascl1, Pitx3, Nurr1, Lmx1a, Foxa2, and En1), as well as the patterning factors Shh and FGF8 [47]. While these iDA expressed many of the relevant markers of dopaminergic neurons, the cells only partially restored dopamine function in vivo, and have failed to exhibit similar levels of mid- brain transcription levels to those found in embryonic or adult midbrain dopamine neurons [47]. More recently, a combination of five transcription factors (Ascl1, Pitx3, Nurr1, Sox2, and Ngn2) generated iDA that further provided benefit when grafted in the 6-hydroxydopamine [6-OHDA ] rat model of PD, suggesting that these reprogrammed cells display functional midbrain dopamin- ergic neuronal properties [48].",

    "text": "Neural transplantation The core loss of the dopaminergic neurons in PD coupled to the response of patients to dopaminergic drugs led in the 1980s to the idea that this condition could be treated through the transplanta- tion of dopaminergic cells into the diseased basal ganglia. This initially involved autografts of the catecholamine-rich adrenal medulla, although the results were generally disappointing both experimentally and in patients. It was therefore not long before this approach was superseded by transplants of fetal ventral mes- encephalic (VM) tissue [49]. This approach involves harvesting the dopaminergic neurons from the developing ventral midbrain and then grafting them into the site where dopamine normally works, namely the striatum. Experimentally, it was shown that this approach worked well when the cells were harvested at the time they normally develop (E13\u201314 in rats and mice; 6\u20138 weeks post conception in humans) as the grafted cells could survive, make, and receive connections from the host brain and release dopamine in a regulated manner with functional benefits to the grafted animal. It was on this background that open label studies were undertaken in patients with PD both in Europe and the US. These studies showed that some patients could derive long-term benefit from these grafts and that these clinical improvements correlated with F-dopa-positron emission tomography (PET) imaging showing evidence of dopamine cell survival at the site of implantation. A correlation that was confirmed in a few post mortem studies [50]. The success of this approach gave confidence in some quarters to push on and undertake more rigorous double blind placebo controlled trials even though the results from the open-label",

However, the use of human fetal tis- sue as the source of cells for grafting is clearly not possible in the long term, for a range of ethical and practical reasons, and as such there is a need to find a more ethically acceptable, readily available source of dopaminergic neurons for grafting [56] (see Table 14.3). One such cell source is ESCs [57]. However, the use of these cells has been hampered by problems of cell overgrowth; immune rejection, and the ability to truly direct them into authentic nigral dopaminergic neurons. Of late though advances have been made in this area with the production of large numbers of A9-looking nigral neurons, which can survive grafting in animal models of PD with functional benefits and no tumour formation [10]. However, even these cells whilst looking very promising fail to grow axons to the extent that fetal dopaminergic neuroblasts do, and they are also, of course, not free of ethical concerns. As an alternative iDA generated from iPSCs derived from patients\u2019 skin fibroblasts are very appealing candidates [58], not only because they circumvent ethical issues but exclude the risk of immune rejection. One other benefit in using iPS cells is the possibility of rejuvenating the cells from an aged patient and thus eliminating the pathologies asso- ciated with ageing to restore tissue proliferation and function. The potential of iDA derived from iPS cells for cell replacement therapy has been assessed [59], and",

Similar observations have been made in human samples [78]. However, at this time it remains unclear if stroke-induced endogenous neurogenesis functionally contributes to recovery [79]. Furthermore, it appears that the number of neu- rons generated is very low. Thus, strategies need to be developed that either enhance the survival or increase the recruitment of newborn cells generated from endogenous NSCs towards the ischaemic lesion. In the case of neural grafting, this has now evolved to the level of early clinical trials, even though their experimental basis is often not that convincing. The most recent of these is a small open-label study by ReNeuron, in which implants of their immor- talized human cortical cell line have been delivered to patients with well-established infarcts. Whilst the data from this study has yet to be published, the preliminary data presented at meet- ings suggests this approach is safe with some small signal of effect (Muir K, personal communication).

How stem cells exactly mediate these effects remains largely unknown, but given that they can be easily deliv- ered into the periphery this approach could translate into the clin- ical setting rather rapidly if proven preclinically to be of value [84]. However, a large problem in MS is the degeneration of axons fol- lowed by neuronal dysfunction that eventually occurs even in the absence of a strong inflammatory state. Thus, strategies aiming to enhance remyelination are urgently required to truly advance regeneration in MS brains. Again in preclinical EAE models, the transplantation of stem cells with the ability to differentiate into oligodendrocytes reduced disease features.

In about 50% of patients the spinal cord injury is due to a traumatic event and for this specific population of patients, rehabilitation standards and outcome assessments have been con- tinuously developed since the first conception and installation of a dedicated SCI rehabilitation programme (in Stoke Mandeville UK, 1942) [91, 92]. Traumatic SCI typically affects healthy and younger subjects (although in the recent decades a shift towards elderly subjects is observed with an increase of the mean age from 30 to 45 years), and compared to other neurological disorders of the brain (like MS, stroke, etc.) constitutes a non-degenerative and non-progressive disorder [93\u201395]. Furthermore, SCI represents a very distinct disorder within the central nervous system due to a rather localized lesion within the cord. Although the spinal cord is embedded in the CNS compartment (sealed by the blood\u2013brain barrier) the SCI also clinically affects important neural structures that project and form part of the peripheral nervous system\u2014 alpha motoneurons. This is clinically evident in",

In these motor segments (myotomes) originating from areas with cord damage, there is always some alpha motoneuron damage, while below the level of lesion motor weakness is due to loss of the descend- ing central motor fibre tracts (i.e. pyramidal spinal tract) [96]. As for the brain, the cord contains neural networks (integration and modulation of in/outputs that affect the facilitation or inhi- bition of neural inputs) and conductive pathways (longitudinal ascending/descending fibre tracts). Accordingly, the cord is not only involved in conveying afferent\u2013efferent signals but also has a capacity to influence even rather complex sensorimotor func- tions (like walking) in a sub-hierarchical capacity relative to the",

The aforementioned findings indicate that the potential use of stem cells to improve the outcome of human SCI can potentially affect many different aspects of the spinal cord.\n\nSo far there is no approved or established treatment of the injured spinal cord itself and all the success achieved to date is through rehabilitation and the better outcome of patients with SCI is based on improved management of secondary medical problems (like bowel and bladder function). Although patients undergoing con- ventional rehabilitation programmes achieve advanced levels of functional outcome they still have a strong desire to improve their medical condition (patients acknowledge that they learned to live with SCI but they want to go beyond this). Due to these strong emotional desires many patients seek any potential treatment and they may even circumvent regulated (i.e. controlled) health care provisions (many will travel abroad to receive unproven treat- ments with any kind of cells). They even accept to pay at their own expense, enormous amounts of money (20,000\u201330,000 USD) to receive these cell applications even though none of the provided interventions have been proven to be effective.",

Clinical phase I/ II trials concentrate on safety and feasibility (route of application, interactions of cells with host, interference of cell transplantation on recovery profiles, etc.) and so far animal models are of limited predictive value in terms of safety concerns [123]. One of the seri- ous anxieties relates to the induction or increase of neuropathic pain, which is frequently an on-going challenge for patients fol- lowing SCI (in about 60\u201370% of patients) [124, 125].

Although the applied cells were of various types of non-CNS auto- grafts, the overall findings revealed the general feasibility of the approach and the surgical risk of cell implantation into the injured spinal cord was considered favourable. The first trial was a Phase I study performed in Israel and assessed the safety of implanting incubated autologous macrophages within 14 days of injury [130]. The premise for this study was based on the concept of \u2018protec- tive autoimmunity\u2019 in which endogenous activated macrophages and T cells are assumed to help augment spinal cord repair in the subacute inflammatory phase (1\u20132 weeks post injury). The study enrolled eight patients with complete injury between C5 and T11 and the intervention consisted of four microinjections (60 \u03bcl) of autologous harvested macrophages (total 4 million cells) at the caudal border of the cord injury. No adverse events were attrib- uted to the experimental therapy, and no acute or delayed morbid- ity associated with the volume or cell dose injected into the spinal cord was observed. This study resulted in a Phase II study that enrolled 50 subjects before study cancellation for financial rea- sons. The safety and efficacy data from this study will be analysed and eventually published [132].",

So far, however, there have been no findings in humans that reveal major or clinically obvious improvements in motor or sensory function.\n\nConclusion The current possibilities for the structural and functional repair of the injured and diseased CNS are still extremely limited and lesions to the adult brain or spinal cord often result in a detrimen- tal and disabling failure of CNS function. Thus, novel therapeutic avenues are needed. The identification of somatic stem cells within the adult nervous tissue and the improved handling and genera- tion of various multipotent and pluripotent human stem cells, has raised hopes that these cells, whether endogenous or transplanted, will be useful for tissue repair. Even though stem cells are today not routinely used in the clinics to treat CNS diseases, a grow- ing number of clinical studies have identified their potential for functional repair or support of injured tissue. Ongoing studies of stem cell-based treatments at this time are starting to explore their tolerability and to some extent efficacy. It seems plausible that dis- eases with a relatively well- defined pathology\u2014that is the loss of distinct cell populations such as dopaminergic cells in the sub- stantia nigra in PD, represent more promising targets compared to those with more diffuse neural tissue damage occurring for exam- ple after stroke.

Scientists and clinicians have been interested in the mechanisms of this recovery for years. Based on observations in animal models of focal CNS injury it is often assumed that a number of processes jointly referred to as neuro- plasticity make a major contribution (see Chapters 13 and 14). Experiments in animal models have demonstrated alterations in cerebral organization that occur after injury are related to recov- ery [1] . Specifically, focal cortical damage in adult brains renders widespread surviving cortical regions more able to change struc- ture and function in response to afferent signals in a way normally only seen in the developing brain ]2]. An increased potential for neuroplasticity will in itself not enhance recovery, but it may increase the impact of training strategies since training works through mechanisms of experience-dependent plasticity [1].",

However, partly because of a growing awareness of the role of neuroplas- ticity there is an interest in designing therapeutic strategies to promote cerebral reorganisation as a way of reducing rather than compensating for impairment. These include incorporating ideas about learning into neurorehabilitation (see Chapter 7) as well as strategies to enhance the potential for neuroplastic change, such as neuropharmacological (see Chapter 17) and non-invasive brain stimulation (see Chapter 16).",

    "text": "Imaging techniques Functional imaging Functional neuroimaging techniques allow examination of human brain function in vivo. In the context of CNS injury, functional brain imaging provides a way of assessing how focal damage to cortical or subcortical regions alters the way surviving neural net- works operate, and how these changes are related to impairment and recovery. Functional imaging of the brain has been carried out with four main techniques: positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electro- encephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG). A detailed theoretical background to the techniques is beyond the scope of this chapter. In brief however, both PET and fMRI rely on the assumption that neuronal activity is closely coupled to a local increase in cerebral blood flow (CBF) secondary to an increase in metabolism. PET relies on mapping the distribution of inert, freely diffusible radioactive tracers deposited in tissue as a func- tion of regional perfusion (rCBF). fMRI comprises different meth- ods, but the studies described in the next section use blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) imaging techniques. During an increase in neuronal activation there is an increase in local CBF, but only a small proportion of the greater amount of oxygen delivered locally to the tissue is used. There is a resultant net increase in the tissue concentration of oxyhaemoglobin and a net reduction in para- magnetic deoxyhaemoglobin in the local capillary bed and drain- ing venules. The magnetic properties of haemoglobin depend on its level of oxygenation so that this change results in an increase in local tissue derived signal intensity on T2*-weighted MR images. EEG and MEG on the other",

MEG directly measures neuronal activity and has a tem- poral resolution in the scale of milliseconds. Studies measuring rCBF with PET are less common now but MEG studies are on the increase.\n\nStructural imaging techniques Ideally, changes in CNS functional organization should be viewed in the context of the anatomy of the structural damage. However, structural imaging in stroke for example, has generally been used to examine the vascular territory involved, without too much con- sideration of the important functions subserved by the grey and white matter structures that are damaged. This is probably because there has been no good way to quantify damage to key structures using computerized tomography (CT) or T1- and T2-weighted MRI. This opened the way for diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), which is sensitive to the diffusion of water molecules within tis- sue. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is based on DWI and allows evaluation of the integrity of the white matter by calculation of fractional anisotropy (FA). Probabilistic DTI tractography uses voxel-wise FA values to map probable fibre trajectories by follow- ing the estimated fibre orientation of successive voxels to generate streamlines connected to chosen start points. These tractography algorithms then provide quantitative information about the integ- rity and orientation of white matter tracts in the brain. Its accu- racy has been validated using post-mortem specimens [3] .",

Although care needs to be taken in conducting and interpreting \u2018task-related\u2019 studies, the differences between stroke patients and healthy controls generally take the form of: (i) overactivations in non-primary motor areas, particu- larly in the contralesional hemisphere; and (ii) shifts in somato- topic representation in primary and possibly non-primary motor areas [9] . In fact, when the relationship between impairment and regional brain activation was examined for the first time, a nega- tive correlation was found between the magnitude of brain activa- tion in secondary motor areas and outcome [10] (Figure 15.1). In other words, this result confirmed that those with more impair- ment were the ones with overactivations previously described.",

Patients with more corticospinal system damage exhibited less task-related activity in ipsilesional M1 (hand area) and greater activity in secondary motor areas in both hemispheres [11]. A similar result was observed in a group of patients with dif- ferent levels of impairment studied at approximately 10 days post stroke illustrating that lesion induced reorganization occurs quickly [12]. These results point to a shift away from primary to secondary motor areas with increasing disruption to corticospinal system, presumably because in some patients ipsilesional M1 is less able to influence motor output. However, this is highly likely to depend on the exact pattern of disruption to the descending pathways.",

    "text": "The evolution of cerebral reorganization after stroke Cross-sectional studies are simpler to perform, but do not tell us is how this reorganized state evolved from the earliest time after infarction. Two early longitudinal studies with early and late time points demonstrated initial task-related overactivations in motor-related brain regions followed by a reduction over time in patients said to recover fully [14, 15]. A detailed multisession longitudinal fMRI study of patients with infarcts not involving M1 looked at changes in motor-related brain activity as a func- tion of recovery (rather than time). At approximately 10\u201314 days after stroke, an initial overactivation was seen in many primary and non-primary motor regions [16]. As in the chronic setting, this was more extensive when the clinical deficit was greatest (i.e. early after stroke). Improvement in motor performance was associated with a steady decrease in task-related activity in these areas (Figure 15.2) suggesting that successful recovery is asso- ciated with a normalization of pathologically enhanced brain activity over time, which has been confirmed by a number of sub- sequent studies [17\u201319]. Even earlier changes were examined by a serial fMRI study, in which stroke patients with motor impair- ment were scanned several times in the first 2 weeks post-stroke starting within 3 days after symptom onset [18]. In those with only mild impairment, task-related activation (movement of the affected hand) was not different from healthy controls. However, in those with more marked impairment, there was a general reduction of cerebral activity in the first 1\u20133 days after stroke, which increased in both hemispheres over and above that seen in healthy controls over",

This is of par- ticular interest as, the balance between inhibition and excitation in the cortex is thought to be a key mediator of neural plastic- ity.

In stroke patients with minimal corticospinal system damage and excellent recovery, the cortical motor system behaved in a way that was similar to younger healthy controls. However, in patients with greater corticospinal system damage, force-related signal changes were seen mainly in contralesional dorsolateral premo- tor cortex, bilateral ventrolateral premotor cortices and contral- esional cerebellum, but not ipsilesional primary motor cortex [28]. A qualitatively similar result was found in healthy volunteers with increasing age suggesting that this \u2018reorganization\u2019 might be a generic property of the cortical motor system in response to a variety of insults [30]. In relation to lesion-induced reorganiza- tion, not only do premotor cortices become increasingly active during movement as corticospinal system integrity diminishes [11], but also take on a new \u2018M1-like\u2019 role during modulation of force output, which implies a new and functionally relevant role in motor control.",

During affected hand movement there was a stronger influence of contralesional PMd on two posterior parts of the ipsilesional sensorimotor cortex [34].

In other words, contralesional M1 overactivity somehow suppresses ipsilesional M1 activity and consequently motor performance and recovery. Others have used this concept to suppress excitability in contralesional M1 using non-invasive brain stimulation, in an attempt to enhance the effect of motor training. There are now many small studies [37]. Although initially positive, the publication bias is gradually being corrected and negative studies are being published [38]. What is likely to emerge is that the anatomical and neurophysiological characteristics of the individual patient will determine if and how it is possible to prime the motor system so that training regimes have more effect.

Clearly, recruitment of secondary motor areas does not get patients back to normal, but the evidence is that in many it is at least supporting what recovered function they have. If so, what are the possible anatomical substrates of this effect? A key determinant of motor recovery is sparing of the fast direct motor pathways from ipsilesional M1 to spinal cord motor neurons [40, 41]. There is little evidence that ipsilateral projections from motor cortex to forelimbs exist in primates [42], although this does not rule out such a possibility in humans. This makes ipsi- lateral projections from contralesional M1 a less likely substrate, but what about those from secondary motor areas? In primates, projections from secondary motor areas to spinal cord motor neurons are usually less numerous and less efficient at exciting spinal cord motoneurons than those from M1 [43, 44].

These medial motor areas are almost always \u2018overactive\u2019 in stroke patients compared to control subjects.\n\nAnother possibility is that premotor areas are able to send descending motor signals via alternative pathways such as reticu- lospinal projections to cervical propriospinal premotoneurons [47\u201349]. These pathways have divergent projections to muscle groups operating at multiple joints [50, 51], which might account for the multijoint \u2018associated\u2019 movements such as the synergistic flexion seen when patients with only poor and moderate recovery attempt isolated hand movements [47]. Although some see these synergistic movements as a barrier to further improvements in motor control (towards \u2018normal\u2019 patterns of movement), it is likely that these patients do not in fact have enough of the appropriate anatomical substrate (fast direct contralateral projections from ipsilesional M1) to support \u2018normal\u2019 movement. In this context, synergistic movements can contribute to functional improvement. Overall, it is feasible that a number of motor networks acting in parallel could generate an output to the spinal cord necessary for movement, and that damage in one of these networks could be at least partially compensated for by activity in another [52, 53].",

In humans, functional brain imag- ing studies of those with spinal cord injury also provide evidence that distant neuronal damage has an impact on organization of the whole sensorimotor system. Studies that have examined brain activity during unaffected hand movements in paraplegic patients have shown a variety of changes [70]. Some, but not all, have dem- onstrated expansion or overrepresentation of one body part in the sensorimotor cortex at the expense of another. The magnitude and topography of cortical reorganization is variable and prob- ably depends on a number of factors, in particular the character- istics of the anatomical damage. To examine these relationships explicitly, a recent study looked at the relationships between struc- tural and functional changes following spinal cord injury [71] and found: (i) cortical thickness in sensorimotor areas was reduced in patients with spinal cord injury; (ii) task-related brain activation during hand grip was greater in M1 (leg) in spinal cord injury subjects with greater cord damage; and (iii) subjects with greater cord damage and greater reduction in tactile sensitivity showed greater brain activation of the face area of left S1 during right median nerve stimulation. Overall then, it is likely that variabil- ity of brain reorganization is driven by differences in anatomical damage. Failure to account for this in studies with small numbers of subjects is likely to lead to contradictory results. These caveats are of course true in stroke studies too, but more",

    "text": "Predicting outcomes with neuroimaging The most obvious way to use neuroimaging to predict outcome after stroke is to assess CNS structure. DTI is able to assess integ- rity of white matter tracts and several studies have demonstrated that greater damage to the corticospinal tract (CST) is associated with more impairment [79], whilst the arcuate fasciculus is being examined in aphasia [80]. These measures may also be used to pre- dict future outcome. CST integrity measured within three weeks of subcortical stroke correlate with both initial and 6 month upper limb impairment [81]. In a separate study, damage to the CST at the posterior limb of the internal capsule (PLIC) 12 hours post- stroke correlated well with motor impairment at 30 and 90 days [82]. These measures were superior to lesion volume and baseline clinical scores in their predictive power. TMS is also used to assess CST integrity and when combining it with DTI within 4 weeks of stroke, TMS had higher positive predictive value than DTI for upper limb function 6 months later, while DTI had higher negative predictive value [83]. Stinear and colleagues are currently develop- ing an algorithm for sequentially combining simple clinical, TMS, and DTI measures to predict upper limb function [84]. The PREP (Predicting REcovery Potential) algorithm was tested in a sample of 40 subacute stroke patients and performed well in predicting motor function based on Action Research Arm Test scores at 12 weeks post-stroke. The performance of DTI in this setting should be improved by making the tracts specific to particular functions (e.g. upper limb [85]) (Figure 15.4), and developing ways for the assessment of tract integrity to be done in a standardized [86] and automatic [87]",

However, three subject clusters are apparent on inspection of the data: a subgroup of subjects with mild tract injury has mild\u2013moderate motor deficits (marked as triangle); subjects with moderate-severe injury have either mild\u2013moderate (marked as circles) or severe (marked as \u2018x\u2019) deficits. This injury/behaviour subgrouping was also apparent for the other three tracts. b) Injury to the tract descending from M1 correlates (r = \u20130.65, p < 0.002) with the treatment-induced change in FM score. Subjects with mild tract injury had greater gains from treatment. A and B indicate the two subjects whose images appear in Figure 15.7.

    "text": "In an approach similar to the subsequent PREP algorithm [84], TMS, structural MRI, and on this occasion, functional MRI were used. In patients with MEPs, meaningful gains with motor practice were still possible 3 years after stroke. The situation in patients without MEPs has always been more difficult to predict in the clinical setting but is often taken as a poor prognostic sign [94]. DTI assessment of CST integrity allowed further stratifi- cation into responders and non-responders. Interestingly, the patients also performed a simple motor task during fMRI, but the results as assessed by the degree of lateralization to one hemi- sphere or the other did not contribute to the predictive model. This kind of study illustrates how multimodal imaging and neu- rophysiological data could be used to assess the state of the motor system and predict the potential for therapy driven functional improvements.",

The result tells us that there is something in the imaging data which is independent of baseline clinical impairment which can predict response to therapy.\n\nIn a second analysis, structural rather than functional imaging was used to try to explain differences in response to intensive reha- bilitation [96]. The likely extent of damage to descending path- ways from each of M1, PMd, PMv, and SMA was calculated from an overlap between the lesion map and the \u2018normal\u2019 map for each of the descending pathways (Figure 15.6). Less damage to M1 and PMd related pathways correlated well with treatment gains, but infarct volume and baseline behaviour did not. Linderberg and colleagues [97] also demonstrated that preserved tract integrity was associated with greater functional gains with bihemispheric cortical stimulation and physical therapy. This result is in keeping with the findings of Riley [96] that a more normal anatomy allows greater change. The anatomy of the damage is likely to set a limit on how well individual patents will respond.",

    "text": "Conclusion In summary, CNS damage leads to reconfiguration of brain net- works with some brain regions adopting the characteristics of damaged or disconnected regions. This reorganization varies across patients, but does so in a way that appears to be at least partially predictable. Reorganization of regions and networks is often not successful in returning performance back to pre-injury levels\u2014the extent of anatomical damage plays a significant limit- ing role\u2014but it probably helps an individual to achieve some of their potential level of recovery. The potential for functionally relevant change to occur will depend on a number of other fac- tors beyond the anatomy of the damage, not least the biologic age of the subject and the premorbid state of their based on levels of neurotransmitters and growth factors which are able to influence the ability of the brain to respond to afferent input might be deter- mined by their genetic status [99]. Predicting treatment effects will be based on understanding the interactions between these factors [39]. It is clear that individual differences will have a major influence on how a patient might respond to restorative therapies, and it is in this context that modern neuroimaging (together with neurophysiological) techniques may be able to shed light on brain reorganization after CNS damage in individual subjects. Future work should aim to use these kinds of approaches to determine whether assessment of individual post-injury residual functional architecture can be a major predictor of outcome, opening the way for stratification of patients based on the likely response to an intervention",

Some of these advances, though not all, relate to the role thought to be played by neuroplasticity, the process by which prior experience can alter the structure and function of the nervous system. This concept is an attractive one, as it raises the possibility that interventions which interact with neuroplasticity may be able to alter the out- come of neurorehabilitation. Non-invasive brain stimulation is one such intervention; its ready availability in the research set- ting, its relatively benign safety profile and a wealth of literature over the last two decades relating to its uses and mechanisms has prompted intense interest in its potential to augment the outcome of neurorehabilitation. The rationale behind this approach is that the application of cortical stimulation at or around the time of conventional therapy may enhance the associated neuroplasticity, with behavioural gains that would outlive the period of stimula- tion and therapy.",

The process of healthy learning is taken here as being analogous to neurore- habilitation: while there are sound arguments for this analogy it remains to some extent an assumption, and efficacy in the context of the normal brain will not necessarily translate into benefit for patients.\n\n3. There are an increasing number of cortical stimulation proto- cols and each contains several variables (stimulation duration, frequency, intensity, site). Clinical studies of cortical stimula- tion in patient groups rarely employ an identical protocol to previous studies, making it hard to replicate or extend prior results. The result of this diversity of approach is that a consen- sus is currently lacking as to the most promising stimulation protocols, a necessary precursor to larger scale clinical trials.",

Its most established clinical application at present is in the treatment of depression, but although this has received the approval of the US Food and Drug Administration its role and efficacy remain controversial [1, 2]. In the context of neurorehabilitation most research has related to improving the motor deficit after stroke [3\u20135], but there is interest also in the use of cortical stimulation for non-motor stroke deficits and in other conditions including traumatic brain injury, Parkinson\u2019s disease, chronic pain, Tourette syndrome, and dystonia [6\u201310].",

There are a number of reasons for this, which we will review in the course of this chapter.\n\n1. The most effective way to use cortical stimulation in a clinical context depends upon what we think it is doing, and at pre- sent this is far from clear. Much of what is known regarding the effects of cortical stimulation in humans comes from experi- ments measuring changes in excitability of motor cortex, itself often measured by brain stimulation.

The authors report an excitability increase in the stimulated motor cortex lasting 60 minutes following 10 minutes\u2019 stimulation [23], although follow-up studies are awaited to confirm the repro- ducibility of these effects.\n\nMechanism of stimulation effects The excitability changes induced by rTMS appear to reflect the induction of a form of synaptic plasticity within the stimulated motor cortex [24]. Spinal recordings suggest that the element of the corticospinal volley reduced by low-frequency rTMS is primarily the late I-waves (indirect waves), which is evoked by trans-synaptic stimulation of the pyramidal cells [25]. Taken together with the lack of change in the stimulus threshold required to induce a response, a measure which is felt to reflect membrane excitability, this suggests that low frequency stimulation exerts its effect by changing the synaptic properties of interneurons within the cortex [26, 27]. The same observation applies to the effects of higher frequency \u2018conventional\u2019 rTMS at 5 Hz, which increases MEP amplitudes in several studies without affecting thresholds [28, 29]. Several studies have also demonstrated that 5 Hz rTMS reduces gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-mediated inhibition within the motor cortex, lending further support to the notion that this form of stimulation produces its effects by modulating synaptic transmission within the cortex [17, 18]. Pharmacological studies of the 5 Hz effect suggest that the synaptic change is more likely to resemble post-tetanic potentiation (N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-independent) than long-term potentiation (LTP) [30].",

The change in excitability during stimulation does not depend on NMDA receptor function but is attenuated by sodium channel or cal- cium channel blockade, implicating the action of voltage-gated channels [35]. It is thus likely that the intrastimulation effects are mediated by the effect of direct current on axonal membrane potentials, rather than by synaptic modulation [36]. The lack of change in motor thresholds suggests that the current primar- ily affects the axons of interneurons rather than pyramidal cells [37]. The post-stimulation effects of tDCS, by contrast, are likely to depend on changes in synaptic efficacy. Pharmacological studies and changes in GABA-mediated inhibition within the cortex suggest that the excitability increase following anodal stimulation depends upon changes at glutamatergic synapses and reduced GABAergic inhibition [38, 39]. The excitability decrease following cathodal stimulation is likewise NMDA receptor-dependent but the role of changes in GABAergic syn- apses is less clear [35, 39]. Magnetic resonance spectroscopy has demonstrated changes in neurotransmitter availability follow- ing tDCS, with reduced GABA following anodal and reduced glutamate following cathodal stimulation [40]. It is interesting to note that direct current induces synaptic plasticity without itself causing the stimulated neurons to discharge. There is endogenous background synaptic activity even at rest, and it is presumed that the depolarization/hyperpolarization of tDCS causes this activity to induce changes in synaptic efficacy. This may be considered analogous to the altered efficacy of high frequency",

This phe- nomenon is routinely encountered when the outcome being meas- ured is a cortical excitability change in the healthy brain [42], and may be expected to be even more problematic when attempting to induce behavioural changes in patients undergoing neurore- habilitation. This point is effectively illustrated by a recent physi- ological study in which the authors applied continuous TBS to 56 healthy volunteers, using a standard protocol which typically reduces excitability at the group level [21]. The post-stimulation MEP amplitudes in individual subjects normalized to baseline are shown in Figure 16.4, and demonstrate that not only the size but also the direction of effect varies considerably between subjects [43]. A number of factors are thought to drive this variability of response, and understanding these is likely to be important when trying to use brain stimulation in a clinical setting.",

[44]. In this model the threshold for induc- tion of LTP- or LTD-like synaptic plasticity varies according to the time-averaged post-synaptic activity: greater recent or current activity raises the threshold for further synaptic strengthening, while less activity has the opposite effect [45]. The self-limiting properties of such a system have given rise to the term \u2018homeo- static plasticity\u2019, and this phenomenon has been invoked to explain the outcome of cortical stimulation in a variety of cir- cumstances. Thus when cathodal tDCS was used to \u2018prime\u2019 the motor cortex with an inhibitory stimulus the effect of subsequent 1 Hz TMS (usually inhibitory) was reversed to facilitation [46].

The direction of an excitability change following TBS may be reversed if stimulation is preceded by either isometric contraction of the target hand muscle for 5 minutes [52] or a brief period of phasic finger move- ments [53]. If paired associative stimulation (PAS), a plasticity induction protocol that combines cortical and peripheral sensory stimulation, is applied soon after a period of motor training its effect on excitability reverses from facilitatory to inhibitory [54]. The outcome of a plasticity induction protocol is likewise sensi- tive to motor activity occurring during the period of stimulation.

A more recent study demonstrated that an interaction between polymorphisms in the genes for BDNF and catechol-O-methyltransferase determines not only the response to PAS but also the level of skill in learning grammar, demonstrat- ing a behavioural correlate of the physiological observation [62], although other studies suggest that there is unlikely to be a simple genetic determinant of plasticity induction [63, 64].",

    "text": "Influencing learning in the healthy brain Cortical stimulation protocols such as those described have become widely used as means of inducing transient changes in cortical function. As well as being useful research tools they also provide a potential means of altering and perhaps enhancing spe- cific aspects of brain function. In general the means by which non-invasive cortical stimulation may enhance a behaviour are either direct, by enhancing cortical function mediating the task in hand, or indirect, by reducing cortical activity that may compete or interfere with task performance. This approach has been applied not only in the field of motor control but also out- side the motor cortex in cognitive neuroscience. It is important to remember however that the majority of information regarding the effects of cortical stimulation and their mechanisms comes from studies of the motor system, and that direct evidence that stimulation has equivalent effects in other cortical regions is at present lacking. We will focus here primarily on the effects of stimulation on motor learning and training, which are summa- rized in Figure 16.5.",

    "text": "Stages and forms of learning When subjects learn a new motor skill there is usually an improvement in performance during training itself (skill acqui- sition) which is associated with a rapid increase in motor cortex excitability [78, 79]. The motor memories acquired may then be strengthened further after training has finished, with increased resistance to interference by subsequent motor activity and even offline performance gains (consolidation) [80, 81]. This process may be blocked by interference in primary motor cortex function immediately after training but not 6 hours [82]: an implied role for this region may in fact not be specific as interference may also be induced by peripheral afferent input, suggesting that competing plasticity in overlapping circuits may disrupt early consolidation [83]. An already consolidated motor memory may become suscep- tible to further alteration while it is reactivated [84] (reconsolida- tion) and modulation of motor cortex activity also influences this process, suggesting that this region may transiently interact with the stored memory trace during movement execution [85]. These stages of learning have generally been defined in relation to the acquisition of a new motor skill, where incremental improvements in performance accrue over a relatively long period of training. Such tasks are sometimes termed \u2018non-rule-based\u2019 learning since participants do not know in advance how to improve their per- formance. They can be distinguished from a more rapid form of learning in which a previously learned movement is performed in the presence of a visuomotor or tactile perturbation\u2014motor adaptation.

Most studies however have used rTMS to \u2018prime\u2019 the target cortical region for subsequent learn- ing, such that training occurs during a period of increased excit- ability. Ten Hz rTMS delivered to the motor cortex for 2 seconds immediately before each training block enhanced training in a sequential motor learning task, although the effect duration was not tested [91].

Interestingly, either facilitatory or inhibitory PAS enhanced performance in a motor learning task if the task was performed immediately after stimulation, suggesting that homeo- static rules do not always govern the interaction between stimu- lation and behaviour [94]. Stimulation of remote but connected regions may also influence training. Inhibitory 1 Hz rTMS applied to the motor cortex ipsilateral to the training hand (i.e. contralat- eral to the active motor cortex) enhanced subsequent training in a sequential key pressing task, presumably by suppressing transcal- losal inhibition [95]. Delivering 1 Hz rTMS to the dorsal premotor cortex (ipsilateral to the active motor cortex) immediately after the completion of motor training over 4 consecutive days specifi- cally improved overnight consolidation, with greater offline per- formance gains [96]. Less is known about the modulation of motor adaptation by rTMS: while continuous (inhibitory) TBS delivered to the primary motor cortex did not affect immediate adaptation to a visuomotor perturbation it appeared to impair re-adaptation after an interval [97].

Thus with regard to motor adaptation, stimulation of the cerebellum modulates learning whereas stimulation of motor cor- tex modulates retention.\n\nSummary of effects on motor training The potential of cortical stimulation to interact with motor train- ing is suggested by common features of the believed mechanisms of these two processes. While it is clearly the case that they do indeed interact, the principles governing the effect of stimulation on training in a given individual are yet to be fully determined. A single subject\u2019s physiological response to one plasticity induc- tion protocol does not reliably correlate with their response to another for example [102]. It is also unknown at present whether an individual\u2019s physiological response to brain stimulation pre- dicts their capacity for training. While a subject\u2019s neurochemi- cal response to tDCS (change in GABA levels as assessed by MR spectroscopy) has been correlated with their capacity to learn a finger sequence task [103], the effect of brain stimulation on corti- cal excitability does not appear to predict the effect on training [63, 92, 104]: as stimulation protocols are often chosen for applica- tion in rehabilitation according to their effect on excitability this dissociation may be important. The variables at play are increas- ingly becoming understood; however, including inter-individual factors, differences between stimulation protocols and the stages of motor learning being targeted. Fuller characterization of these factors is likely to be an essential prerequisite to successful clinical application.",

    "text": "Evidence from transcranial direct current stimulation There is now evidence that tDCS can influence the outcome of motor training. Although in the most commonly used montages the anode is placed over the primary motor cortex, the field of influence is considerably less focal than that resulting from rTMS and is likely to modulate excitability in several nodes of the net- work engaged in training. The observed effect depends crucially upon the timing of stimulation relative to training. When deliv- ered immediately before training in a sequence learning task both anodal and cathodal stimulation reduced the rate of learning, whereas when delivered concurrently the effect on learning was polarity-dependent: faster with anodal, slower with cathodal [36]. A similar beneficial effect on sequence learning may be observed using bihemispheric stimulation, with the anode placed over the motor cortex contralateral to the training hand and the cathode over the homologous ipsilateral motor cortex, although there was no additional benefit over the more usual electrode montage [98]. Reis and colleagues studied the effect of applying anodal tDCS to the active motor cortex during training in an isometric pinch task over 5 days, and found that learning was enhanced over sham and that the benefit was sustained at 3 months [12]. Interestingly, tDCS in this study specifically enhanced offline gains between ses- sions, suggesting an effect on subsequent consolidation. Anodal stimulation delivered immediately after the completion of motor sequence learning also enhanced subsequent performance of the learned sequence [99]. Anodal tDCS applied to the cerebellum during a motor adaptation task was associated with faster error correction during",

There is also, however, a large and growing literature regarding the enhancement of cognitive function by this approach. While this is too extensive to be reviewed fully here, certain studies are of potential relevance to neurorehabilitation and these primar- ily employ tDCS. A polarity- and timing-specific beneficial effect of tDCS on acquisition of a visuomotor task may be induced not only by stimulation of the motor cortex, but alternatively the V5 region of extrastriate visual cortex, although the non-focal nature of tDCS should be kept in mind when interpreting the specific region said to be stimulated [105]. Stimulation of anterior tem- poral regions has been reported to improve visual memory [106] and name recall [107]. Stimulation of the left posterior perisylvian region enhances both performance in a language task and the learning of new words [108, 109]. Fregni and colleagues targeted the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and found that anodal but not cathodal stimulation improved performance of a task test- ing working memory [110], while stimulation of the same region has also been noted to improve planning in the Tower of London task in a manner dependent on the polarity of stimulation and the phase of training targeted [111]. When applied during slow wave sleep, stimulation of frontal regions also improved consoli- dation of learning in a declarative memory task [112].

This is likely to relate partly to the high prevalence of stroke, which as the leading cause of adult disability in the developed world has an enormous social and economic cost [122, 123]. Stroke is also attractive as a model for stimulation-enhanced neuroreha- bilitation as it presents a relatively focal lesion in what may be an otherwise intact system, at least macroscopically. Following an ischaemic stroke resulting in a motor deficit a number of abnormalities may be observed within the remaining cortical network. Functional imaging studies have revealed increased activation of non-primary motor cortical regions and of a num- ber of regions in the contralesional hemisphere during move- ment of the paretic limb [124, 125]. Physiological studies using TMS have demonstrated that excitability of the corticospinal tract is commonly depressed in the stroke hemisphere but may be pathologically increased in the intact hemisphere [126, 127]. By contrast, disinhibition may be observed in the GABAergic intracortical circuits which regulate corticospinal output, both in the stroke hemisphere and the intact hemisphere [128\u2013130].

In healthy subjects the interhemispheric interaction is inhibitory at rest but switches to causing facilitation imme- diately before movement onset; in patients with stroke, by con- trast, inhibition is removed but not replaced by facilitation prior to movement onset.

    "text": "but when Kim and colleagues [174] combined tDCS with physi- cal and occupational therapy there was no additional benefit over sham stimulation at 10 days but a marked difference at 6 months. These studies lend a degree of support for the proposed mecha- nism of action whereby the balance of excitability between the two homologous motor cortices is redressed by stimulation in favour of the stroke hemisphere. It is difficult to reach a firm conclusion on this front in view of the small sample sizes used for regression. Despite many promising proof-of-principle studies and small clinical trials, however, there has been a notable failure to repro- duce clinical benefit when testing larger patient numbers. Two separate trials of anodal stimulation in the acute post-stroke period, using a similar protocol but higher current to that applied successfully to the subacute period [166], showed no beneficial effect of stimulation vs sham on functional scores. In the study of Hesse and colleagues [175] a significant proportion of patients were severely affected at baseline (mean Fugl-Meyer score approximately 8/66, several patients with total anterior circula- tion infarction), which may potentially explain the lack of effect, but this did not apply to the patients studied by Rossi and col- leagues [176] who had a wider range of baseline impairment. It seems likely that differing effects of stimulation may be observed depending on severity and stroke location, and this is supported by the results obtained by Bradnam and colleagues [180], in whose study cathodal stimulation of the intact hemisphere was benefi- cial to performance in an isometric biceps task in patients with milder impairment but detrimental in more impaired patients.",

Comparisons of anodal vs cathodal stimulation have found variably in favour of the former [172] or the latter [167]. The importance of stimulation intensity used remains unclear, with a range from 1 to 2 mA commonly employed, but no formal comparison available in stroke patients. The most effective duration of stimulation is not known, ranging in patient studies from 7 to 30 minutes [177, 179]. Worryingly, while most patient studies employ a longish period of stimulation such as 25 minutes, a recent study in healthy subjects demon- strated that the facilitatory effects of anodal tDCS may in fact be reversed when it is prolonged [50]. The lack of success with larger patient number emphasises the importance of resolving these questions before Phase III trials would be feasible or ethical.",

Anodal (excitatory) tDCS delivered to the stroke hemisphere, in combination with swallow training over 10 days, induced a delayed improvement at 3 months [197], while anodal stimulation to the intact hemisphere induced a measurable improvement after a single session [198]. The rationale for using non-invasive brain stimulation to treat post-stroke dysphagia differs from that for other deficits in that the motor component of swallowing is bilaterally represented, so the likely effect of altering an interhemispheric balance is less clear.",

    "text": "Summary of cortical stimulation after stroke: does it work? For most forms of neurological deficit evident after stroke there are one or more studies demonstrating a beneficial effect of non-invasive brain stimulation. Earlier studies tend to have used stimulation to induce a transient behavioural enhancement, while more recently investigators have tended to combine stimulation with a form of training. Considering these studies together there is enormous heterogeneity of design with regard to chronicity of stroke, single vs multiple sessions, severity of baseline impair- ment, involvement of cortical structures, outcome measures used and stimulation protocol. It is thus difficult for review arti- cles and formal meta-analyses to draw meaningful conclusions. With regard to motor function, reviews have variously concluded that \u2018it might be possible to harness effects (of stimulation) in a therapeutic setting\u2019 [199], or that stimulation \u2018may be beneficial in enhancing motor recovery\u2019 [3] . One recent meta-analysis of rTMS after stroke [165] found a significant positive effect of stimula- tion on motor function, with an effect size of 0.55, although both single- and multiple-session studies were included and a variety of outcome measures employed, while another by contrast con- cluded that that \u2018the routine use of rTMS for patients with stroke",

In Parkinson\u2019s disease cortical stimulation may be used to modulate activity within corticobasal loops and thereby influence the motor state. Some studies have delivered excitatory stimulation to the primary motor cortex [200, 201] with beneficial effects on bradykinesia. Others have delivered inhibi- tory stimulation to the primary motor cortex [202], the supple- mentary motor area [203] or the cerebellum [204], with transient improvements in levodopa-induced dyskinesia. In patients with writer\u2019s cramp inhibitory stimulation of the premotor cortex tran- siently improves symptoms [205]. Inhibitory stimulation applied to the motor cortex appeared in a preliminary study to slow clini- cal progression in patients with motor neurone disease [206], but a larger trial with 20 patients showed no effect [207]. Inhibitory rTMS delivered over multiple sessions shows promise as a strategy to reduce seizure frequency in patients with intractable epilepsy [208, 209].

Dopaminergic stimulation exerts a non-linear dose-dependent effect on effects of stimula- tion, with abolition of excitability change at low or high dosage but inversion or prolongation of the effect at medium dosage. This inverted U-shaped curve emphasizes that dosage is likely to be crucially important when trying to influence plasticity with medication. Of particular note perhaps are the significant prolongations of stimulation effect noted in the presence of cit- alopram and amphetamine, both of which groups of medica- tion themselves have some evidence for benefit after stroke in humans or animal models. It is important to remember that effects of stimulation on corticospinal excitability do not nec- essarily translate into improvements in behavioural measures. Notwithstanding this cautionary note, the approach of combin- ing brain stimulation with medication is certainly promising as an avenue of investigation but is currently in its infancy as a therapeutic strategy.",

At present, the principal obstacles to translating this approach into clinical practice are the interindividual variability of response with current stimulation protocols, and the heteroge- neity of protocols tested (and outcome measures used) across different centres. Resolving these key issues is essential before it will be feasible or ethical to conduct clinical trials of sufficient size to influence clinical practice. It is likely that the efficacy of brain stimulation in the clinical setting may be increased by using it in combination with neuromodulatory medication or other pharmacological promoters of endogenous plasticity, and this represents a promising future direction for research. The rewards of developing non-invasive stimulation as a clinical tool are potentially great. Together with other branches of restorative neuroscience this approach provides the opportunity to reduce neurological impairment, and hence disability, in patients undergoing rehabilitation. Applying such techniques correctly to appropriate patients has the potential to produce clinical ben- efits whose magnitude equals or exceeds that observed in other branches of clinical neuroscience. If this can be achieved then neurological rehabilitation as a discipline may shed its unde- served inferiority complex, and join the ranks of neurological specialties in which advances in neuroscience translate into ben- efit for patients.",

    "text": "Pharmacological modulation of stimulation-induced LTP in motor cortex: animal studies In the rat motor cortex, long-term potentiation (LTP) usually requires activation of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) recep- tor (NMDAR) [1\u20133]. Local disinhibition of rat motor cortex by iontophoretic application of bicuculline, an antagonist of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptor (GABAAR), results in unmasking of latent horizontal intracortical connec- tions and rapid changes in representational organization [4] . This seminal paper, therefore, identified GABAA-ergic inhibitory cor- tical circuits as of crucial importance in regulating synaptic plas- ticity and map reorganization. Accordingly, LTP is facilitated if the rat motor cortex is locally disinhibited by bicuculline [2, 3, 5]. Similarly, LTP is facilitated in the disinhibited non-lesional sur- round tissue of experimentally induced focal infarction in rat sen- sorimotor cortex [6]. In contrast, diazepam, a benzodiazepine and positive allosteric modulator at the GABAAR, prevents the induc- tion of LTP in rat motor cortex [7]. Neuromodulating transmit- ters such as dopamine (DA), norepinephrine (NE), acetylcholine (ACh), and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) can exert sig- nificant effects on neocortical LTP (for review see [8]), but studies that have addressed pharmacological modulation of LTP in motor cortex are still limited. The dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH23390 and the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist raclopride reduce LTP induction in rat primary motor cortex, indicating an important supportive role of dopaminergic neurotransmission in synaptic plasticity [9]. Similarly, pharmacological blockade of muscarinic receptors by atropine prevented the",

LTP-like plasticity is typically expressed by long-term increase in the amplitude of the motor evoked potential (MEP), elicited by single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of the motor cortex, before and after the NIBS induction protocol,\n\nand recorded by surface electromyography (EMG), typically from a hand muscle contralateral to the stimulated motor cor- tex [18, 19]. The term \u2018LTP-like\u2019 has been coined [20] because the increase in MEP amplitude exhibits close similarity compared to LTP as defined and studied at the cellular/molecular level, such as cooperativity, input-specificity, associativity, duration (>30 min), and dependence on NMDA receptor activation, but investigation is necessarily indirect at the systems level [14, 21].",

    "text": "1. GABAergic disinhibition: no anti-GABAergic drugs are avail- able for human use due to their adverse pro-convulsive effects. However, GABAergic disinhibition can be experimentally induced by transient limb ischaemic nerve block [22, 23]. This GABAergic disinhibition permits LTP-like plasticity induc- tion to occur by low-frequency (0.1 Hz) repetitive TMS (rTMS) [24, 25] a protocol that does not produce overt MEP change when given alone [26].\n\n2. GABAergic inhibition: Neurotransmission through the GABAAR is enhanced by benzodiazepines, allosteric posi- tive modulators of the GABAAR. The permissive effect of GABAergic disinhibition on low-frequency rTMS induced LTP-like plasticity can be prevented by the benzodiazepine lorazepam [25]. Lorazepam reduces LTP-like plasticity induced by high-frequency (5 Hz) rTMS [27]. The benzodiazepine diaz- epam and the GABA-reuptake inhibitor tiagabine [28] and the GABAB receptor (GABABR) agonist baclofen [29] reduce LTP-like plasticity induced by paired associative transcranial magnetic stimulation (PAS). An additional subthreshold condi- tioning pulse 2 ms prior to the PAS test pulse, that would produce GABAA-ergic intracortical inhibition [30, 31], is also capable of blocking PAS-induce LTP-like plasticity [32]. Lorazepam atten- uates LTP-like plasticity induced by anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in the first 10 min after stimulation [33], but MEP amplitude increases at later time points, an as of yet unexplained observation.",

The DA precursor levodopa enhances PAS-induced LTP-like plasticity [40] but switches the LTP-like effect induced by anodal tDCS to an LTD-like effect [40, 41]. The enhancement of PAS-induced LTP-like plasticity by levodopa shows an inverted U-shaped dose dependency [42). The DA D2 receptor agonist cabergoline has no effect on PAS-induced LTP-like plasticity while the D2 receptor antagonist haloperi- dol suppresses it [43]. Ropinirole, another D2 receptor agonist, demonstrates an inverted U-shaped dose dependent suppres- sion of PAS- and anodal tDCS-induced LTP-like plasticity at low and high doses but no difference to placebo at intermediate doses [44]. The selective D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride blocks LTP-like plasticity induced by TBS [45] and anodal tDCS [46] but has no significant effect on LTP-like plasticity induced by PAS [47]. Addition of the D1/D2 receptor agonist pergolide does not prevent the suppression of anodal tDCS-induced LTP-like plasticity by sulpiride, underscoring the significance of D2 receptors in regulating LTP-like plasticity in human motor cortex [46]. In summary, agonists versus antagonists of the D2 receptor enhance or suppress, respectively, LTP-like plasticity in human motor cortex, but the results are not fully consistent and may depend non-linearly on dose, the balance of neuro- transmission through D1 vs. D2 receptors, and the stimulation protocol to induce LTP-like plasticity.",

There exists a wealth of animal studies on pharmacological alteration of (motor) learning behav- iour in intact animals (for review see [58, 59]) and in animals after stroke lesion (for reviews see [59, 60]). It is beyond the scope of this chapter to provide a critical or even comprehensive review of this extensive research field. In addition, the problem with virtually all of these studies is that the observed behavioural effects were not submitted to investigation of the underlying mechanisms at the level of practice-dependent representational plasticity in the motor cortex. Therefore, these studies provide no link between neurophysiological mechanism and behavioural effect, and there- fore, interpretation is rather limited. In the following, single studies will be reviewed that were influential in the field, serve as important examples for modulating effects of drugs with different modes of action, and as primers for the human studies in the fol- lowing sub-chapter.",

Despite these favourable effects, D-cycloserine, compared to saline injected control animals, does not affect final infarction size or secondary brain atrophy [66]. These data are of particular interest because it was long thought that excessive NMDAR activation in the acute stage after ischaemic stroke may contribute to delayed excitotoxic neuronal death [67]. However, all of the NMDAR antagonists studied so far have failed to show efficacy in large controlled clini- cal trials and, in some of these trials, NMDAR antagonists even worsened clinical outcome (for review see [68]). The findings from the D-cycloserine trial in the MCAO rat support a beneficial role for NMDAR stimulation during the recovery period after stroke, most likely caused by enhanced neuroplasticity rather than neu- roprotection [66].

This effect is blocked by the dopamine D2 receptor antagon- ist haloperidol or by restraining the animals for 8 hours begin- ning immediately after amphetamine administration [71]. The dramatic effect of d-amphetamine vs. saline on walking beam performance in stroke rats can be appreciated in the Video 17.1 (http://www.unm.edu/~feeney/movicap.html).",

When on the beam the affected limbs (especially hindlimb) are not placed on the surface as in normal rats. These symptoms are best observed by placing the rat on a narrow elevated beam as few deficits are apparent when the animal is on a flat surface. Recovery from hemiplegia can be quantified by utilization of a rating scale designed for this beam-walk task. In untreated rats, spontaneous recovery of locomotion occurs in about a week. Size and location of cortical lesions affect the symptoms and recovery rate. The remainder of the video illustrates the remarkable improvement in locomotion within 20 min after administering a drug increasing norepinephrine (NE) release.

Given this lack of preclinical evidence for a recovery-enhancing role of serotonin in animal models of stroke, it is interesting to note that the first successful prospective phase IIb randomized clinical trial (FLAME trial) investigated the effects of fluoxetine (20 mg/day) versus placebo on recovery of paretic arm/hand func- tion in patients after ischaemic stroke [83] (for details, see the section \u2018Impact of pharmacological modulation on neurorehabili- tation of stroke\u2019).

The strongest supporting evidence comes from interference experiments in rats: successful motor skill learning suppresses the subsequent induction of LTP in the training motor cortex when compared to LTP in an untrained motor cortex [85\u201388]. The same homeostatic interference between motor learning and subsequent induction of LTP-like plasticity is found in the intact human motor cortex [20, 89, 90]. From this tight interdependence of LTP and motor learning it is reasonable to assume that pharma- cological modulation of LTP and motor learning are similar [91]. This paragraph will focus on the pharmacological modulation of learning of repetitive simple movements, a form of training that is particularly effective in motor rehabilitation after stroke [92, 93].

Furthermore, PROTOCOL B does not use MEP amplitude as an outcome measure for motor plasticity assessment. This is an advantage because MEP amplitude is rather indirectly linked to practice-dependent plasticity [100, 101]. Finally, all studies under PROTOCOL C report dissociation with effective pharmaco- logical modulation of motor cortical representational plastic- ity, but lacking pharmacological effects on the improvement of motor performance. This suggests that motor cortical plasticity is not a sufficient prerequisite for motor learning. It may well be a prerequisite for motor memory formation and lasting improve- ment in motor performance, but this has not been tested in any of the PROTOCOL C studies.

These two studies are extremely important because, for the first time, they go beyond the purely clinical eval- uation of motor outcome and move pharmacological modulation of practice-dependent plasticity in healthy subjects (see section on \u2018Pharmacological modulation of practice-dependent plasticity in motor cortex: human studies\u2019) to the clinical stage. Exploration of pharmacological modulation of practice-dependent plastic- ity by electrophysiological and neuroimaging techniques may advance our knowledge on the mechanisms that enhance recovery of function after stroke lesion and, potentially, allow testing and predicting the responsiveness to a particular pharmacotherapy in individual patients.",

This improvement is associated with an increase in the MEP amplitude in practice hand muscles [131].\n\nDopamine A single dose of 100mg/d of levodopa given over 3 weeks and combined with conventional physiotherapy improves motor recovery when compared to placebo in ischaemic stroke patients an effect that is maintained 3 weeks after the end of levodopa treatment [132]. This study was influential as it was one of the first prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pharmacological trials in stroke rehabilitation, but also criti- cized because the levodopa vs. placebo groups were not balanced for age and stroke hemisphere, and other factors of importance for determining stroke outcome such as stroke location and stroke size were not even mentioned. Other more recent levo- dopa trials are listed in Table 17.3. The findings are inconsistent, so that the efficacy of levodopa in enhancing stroke rehabilita- tion is currently not clear.",

    "text": "Norepinephrine Based on the early evidence on the recovery enhancing effects of d-amphetamine in the rat [71], the first controlled randomized clinical trial ever to enhance recovery in stroke patients tested the effects of d-amphetamine [133]. This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled pilot study in acute stroke patients (less than 10 days after stroke) showed that a single dose of 10 mg of d-amphetamine coupled with physiotherapy enhances motor recovery as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Scale more than placebo. However, it is not clear to which extent spontaneous recovery differences in this small sample of acute stroke patients contributed to the results. Furthermore, this ini- tial finding could not be replicated in several other trials (see Table 17.3) and d-amphetamine has potentially serious adverse effects (in particular blood pressure elevation, increased mortal- ity) so that d-amphetamine is no longer considered as a primary choice in pharmacotherapy of stroke rehabilitation [134]. Novel selective NE reuptake inhibitors such as reboxetine may have a superior safety profile. One particularly interesting recent study showed that a single oral dose of 6 mg of reboxetine significantly increases maximum grip power and index finger-tapping speed of the paretic hand of subacute or chronic stroke patients [135]. This enhanced motor performance is associated with a reduction of cortical hyperactivity toward physiological levels, especially in the ipsilesional ventral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. Connectivity analyses revealed that in stroke patients neural coupling of ipsilesional primary motor cortex with ventral premotor cortex and supplementary motor area is significantly reduced",

The trial showed that early (within the first 5\u201310 days after stroke) initiation of a daily dose of 20 mg of fluoxetine in combination with physiotherapy improves recovery, measured by the Fugl-Meyer Scale, 90 days after stroke compared to placebo. Although this is an impressive and clinically relevant result the mechanisms underlying this recovery enhancing effect remained unexplored. The fluoxetine group also shows a signifi- cantly lower occurrence of depression at 90 days compared to the placebo group, which may have contributed (non-specifically) to the enhanced motor recovery, even though the superiority of fluoxetine over placebo as measured by the Fugl-Meyer Scale was independent of the effect of fluoxetine on depression [83]. The finding that fluoxetine improves the rate of favourable outcomes measured by the modified Rankin Scale [83] has important public health implications as this rate improvement is similar to those achieved with thrombolytic therapy [136]. Unlike thrombolytic therapy, however, the usefulness of which is limited by having to give it within 4.5 h of stroke onset [137], an selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) could be given to a much larger cohort of stroke patients, as there is no (known) critical time window.",

    "text": "Limitations and outlook Pharmacological enhancement of neuroplasticity and neuroreha- bilitation success is still an emergent field, despite its longstand- ing tradition in preclinical research. Evidence-based guidelines are not yet available and recent systematic reviews conclude that more evidence by adequately powered large-scale randomized controlled clinical trials is warranted before more definite rec- ommendations can be given as the presently available evidence is promising but largely based on small-scale proof-of-principle studies [120, 155]. Also, the optimal interval after onset of brain injury to the start of pharmacological augmentation, the frequency and dose of medication, the optimal duration of medication and rehabilitation, and the intensity and components of concomitant skills practice, remain important features for the design of ran- domized clinical trials [156]. On the other hand, a recent Phase IIb randomized double-blind placebo-controlled parallel group clinical trial with 118 stroke patients demonstrated clinically rel- evant efficacy of early treatment with the selective serotonin reup- take inhibitor fluoxetine in enhancing stroke recovery [83]. The rate of improvement of disability as measured with the modified Rankin Scale 90 days post-stroke was comparable to the benefit obtained in thrombolysis trials for acute stroke treatment [136]. The effect size on the Fugl-Meyer Motor Score 90 days post-stroke in the fluoxetine trial, expressed by Cohen\u2019s d was 0.76, indicating a strong effect [83]. This opens up the realistic perspective that early pharmacotherapy for enhancing stroke recovery becomes a standard practice with clinically meaningful effects in the man- agement of subacute stroke",

One important issue relates to the complexity of stroke pathobiology: \u2018therapy must acknowledge the \u201cJanus-faced\u201d nature of many stroke targets and must identify endogenous neuroprotective and repair mechanisms\u2019 [84]. That is, excitability decreasing pharmacotherapy (e.g. by anticonvulsants) in the acute phase of stroke may be neuroprotective but this posi- tive effect may be overridden by detrimental effects on neuroplas- ticity and recovery [121, 157]. In addition, recovery-modulating drugs may have potentially serious adverse effects that limit their wide application, such as blood pressure elevation and increased mortality by d-amphetamine [134].",

    "text": "Furthermore, it is not clear to what extent effects of pharmaco- logical modulation on ischaemic stroke recovery reviewed in this chapter can be generalized to other causes of acquired lesions of the central nervous system, such as traumatic brain injury or spi- nal cord injury. While it appears that there is large consistency for traumatic brain injury and ischaemic stroke (for reviews see [130, 158, 159]), there are also examples of divergence: For instance, patients with incomplete spinal cord injury do not benefit from adding levodopa to training of gait [160] while add-on treatment with levodopa improves motor recovery patients after ischaemic stroke [122, 132]. Clonidine, an \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist, and therefore an inhibitor of presynaptic NE release, impairs recovery of function in an animal model of focal traumatic brain injury [161], and was identified as a \u2018detrimental drug\u2019 in motor recovery after ischaemic stroke in humans [121], while clonidine has demonstrated beneficial effects in combination with locomo- tor training in patients with severe but incomplete spinal cord injury (for review see [162]). The reasons for these discrepancies are only partly understood. Likely, they are related to the specific functions of neuromodulating neurotransmitters in neuronal circuits of cerebral cortex versus spinal cord. For instance, the presynaptic inhibition of NE release in spinal cord circuitry by clonidine can lead to relief from pain and spasticity, and induce concomitant changes towards normalization of the cyclic EMG locomotor activation pattern in incomplete spinal cord injury patients [162], while the same mechanism of presynaptic inhibi- tion of NE release in cerebral cortex has detrimental effects on",

This chapter demonstrates that animal models are generally very useful for identification of mechanisms that may be of translational value for clinical applications. However, this is not a straight avenue, and the chapter closes with the urgent recommendation that future clini- cal trials should include measurements of network reorganization, using fMRI, EEG, MEG, or TMS (for laudable examples, see [122, 123, 135]), in addition to clinical endpoints, in order to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying recovery enhance- ment and to open opportunities for applying more specific interven- tions to residual neuronal networks in individual stroke patients.",

This refers to inten- sive assisted locomotor training on a treadmill in combination with body weight support (BWS). The idea behind this therapy stems from animal studies, in which it has been shown that load feedback is essential for the regulation of gait and that training on a treadmill with assistance can restore gait even after com- plete transection of the spinal cord. The theoretical background of treadmill training has been described in several papers and there- fore only a brief summary is given here in this chapter. The the- ory states that activation of sensory pathways, which have direct access to the central pattern generator (CPG), can re-establish basic locomotor rhythmicity.",

Incidence rates of non-traumatic SCI are less clear because of the multitude of possible causes. The term SCI is commonly used for an injury to the spinal cord caused by trauma.\n\nThe pathophysiology of a SCI involves both a primary and sec- ondary injury. The initial mechanical trauma results in damage of both central and peripheral neural pathways by the traction and compression of displaced bone fragments, disc material and liga- ments. Micro-hemorrhages immediately occur which will expand in the spinal cord to fill up the entire diameter of the spinal canal at the level of the injury. This expansion, in turn, will lead to sec- ondary ischemia (i.e. release of toxic chemicals from disrupted neural membranes), which will then trigger the secondary injury cascade. During the secondary injury, toxic chemicals released by previously damaged structures (e.g. axons, blood vessels) attack neighbouring cells (excitotoxicity).",

The symp- toms (and their severity) vary among SCI patients and are depend- ent on the location of the lesion of the spinal cord and the severity of injury. SCI can affect the conduction of both sensory and motor signals, but also the autonomic nervous system. The International Standards for Neurological Classification of Spinal Cord Injury (ISNCSCI) is widely used to document the sensory and motor impairments in a SCI person [1] . The American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) classes range from A (complete) to E (normal). This classification is based on an extensive neurological examina- tion of the sensations in each dermatome (area of the skin mainly innervated by the sensory axons within one segmental nerve) and the strength of the muscles in several myotomes (collection of muscle fibres supplied by the motor axons within one segmen- tal nerve). Such examination allows classifying SCI persons (with varying symptoms) into several categories. Based on the tests, one can then know the sensory level (the neurologically lowest, nor- mally innervated dermatome) and motor level (the most caudal key muscle function with a grade of 3 or higher [on manual mus- cle testing], providing the key muscle functions more cranial are intact), the completeness of the lesion (a complete injury is defined as the absence of sacral sparing; that is no sensory or motor func- tion in the lowest sacral segments), and whether there is a zone",

At 1 year post- stroke, the most noticeable area of difficulty appeared to be endur- ance, as measured by the 6-minute walk test. Only 50% of their sample was able to complete this test, and to walk, on average, about 250 metres, which is equivalent to 40% of their predicted ability. Geurts and colleagues reviewed recovery of standing balance after stroke and reported that recovery shows considerable inter-indi- vidual variability, depending on initial deficits [3]. Nevertheless, recovery is noted by improvement of stability in the anteroposterior and mediolateral plane, the ability to compensate for perturbations, and the ability to voluntary control posture. The review suggests that true restoration through recovery of paretic leg muscles in the first 3 months may improve standing balance but alternatively, mechanisms are suggested that improve standing balance without clear signs of improved support function or balance reaction in the paretic leg. Possible mechanisms suggested by the authors are improved core stabilisation, compensation through the non-paretic leg, and increased self-confidence [3].",

    "text": "Principles of therapy and management Gait and balance training in SCI After a transection of the spinal cord, the locomotor behaviour depends on automaticity from circuits in the lumbosacral spinal cord (i.e. CPGs; [4] ). An additional important component of auto- maticity is the sensory input to the spinal cord from the periph- ery [5, 6]. This sensory input from cutaneous and proprioceptive sources is needed to assist the CPGs, to automatically switch from one phase to another. It has been argued that such mechanisms are important for humans as well and that this is the basis for the use of treadmill training as this provides the essential sen- sory stimulation to activate the spinal CPGs (see previous section; also [7\u20139]). Experimental evidence was obtained by the Harkema group for the contention that the isolated human spinal cord can interpret both loading [10] and velocity signals [11]. Most reha- bilitation strategies employ repetitive and intensive practice of gait (for instance using [body weight supported] treadmill training). This training then provides task-specific sensory input associated with appropriate stepping movements.",

In the\n\ngroup of incomplete SCI, clear positive effects can be obtained even for training long after the injury [13, 14]. Recovery also depends on the level of the lesion. For example, a relationship was reported between the level of the lesion in motor complete SCI patients and their orthotic gait performance [15]. Their results indicated that the slower gait speed and higher energy cost in patients with the SCI at a higher thoracic level was due to their limited hip motion and presumed increased upper limb load.",

Therefore, pro- moting the recovery of (independent) gait has been one of the major topics of research [16]. Initially, it was suggested that repetitive gait retraining was more beneficial when applied sooner rather than later after the onset of injury in people with motor-incomplete lesions [16]. However, there is a limit and very early training can even be detrimental unless it is aimed at an enhancement of appro- priate proprioceptive input [6] . Conversely, if no training is given in chronic SCI patients, the locomotor activity in the leg muscles exhausts rapidly during assisted locomotion. This is accompanied by a shift from early to dominant late spinal reflex components [17]. One important issue is the quantitative assessment of the pro- gress made during gait rehabilitation. Functional tests are able to demonstrate the changes in behaviour, for example the maximum walking speed. In the first pioneering studies of this kind, these tests were the only ones available [18]. However, such measures are often crude and unreliable. Therefore there was a need to use more sophisticated assessment measures in order to better understand the underlying mechanisms of improvement. Thus, it was pro- posed to use objective measurements, such as measures of electro- myography (EMG), to better document the progress made during the training. There are different ways to measure the changes in EMG activity during the training programme. First, one can measure the EMG as the performance level of the SCI person improves. This means that one measures EMGs at",

For a proper rehabili- tation intervention it is crucial to have a good understanding of the scientific background, yet \u2018 . . . the neurophysiology underpin- ning stroke rehabilitation is often poorly established\u2019 [23]. Some reviews are available, summarizing the work on animal models [24] or on humans [3, 23]. In short, such studies emphasize that stable standing requires a combination of elements, including muscle strength, proper afferent input, and the ability to incorpo- rate this input into one\u2019s own body scheme. Recovery of one of the elements is not sufficient and this may explain, for example, why physiological recovery of paretic leg muscle functions (particularly during the first 3 months post-stroke) does not necessarily predict improvement in support and balance functions [3] . Other mecha- nisms are likely to be just as important. In particular, the normal sensory integration appears to be critical for balance recovery. Hence, brain lesions involving the parietotemporal junction are especially devastating for poor postural control. Nevertheless, the majority of stroke patients show considerable improvement in standing balance after rehabilitation. Most of them have unilat- eral supratentorial brain infarction or haemorrhage and there may be some effect of lateralization as well since studies on stroke have indicated that the right hemisphere plays a more dominant role in postural control than the left hemisphere [25].",

Several training programmes and assessment methods have been proposed, but we will focus here on just a few which we consider especially important. The ability to make voluntary weight shifts has long been known to be essential for gait initiation and the evaluation of this ability can be performed quite reliably [21]. Since one of the major deficits in standing balance in stroke is asymmetrical weight-bearing, it is evident that training and assessment has been targeted often at such weight-shifting tasks [27]. Typically, with this type of training, stroke patients increased both their walking speed and their precision of weight shifting. Even severe stroke patients (selected for inpatient rehabilitation) improved significantly. However, both old age and the presence of hemineglect affected progress. Nevertheless, most patients improved but some degree of weight-transfer time asymmetry persisted. Similar results were obtained in a more recent study on chronic stroke subjects, based on a 4-week training programme using both static and dynamic balance exercises with visual feedback [28]. Balance control was assessed with clinical measures (Berg Balance Scale) and with a pressure platform to register the centre of pressure (CoP) during quiet stance and during a forward reach task. The stroke patients improved their Berg Balance score and their performance on quiet standing, but again the weight distribution remained somewhat abnormal. Hence, this type of training programme improves bal- ance control but not weight distribution.",

    "text": "Walking The abnormalities of gait in stroke have been well-documented. Stroke patients walk with reduced speed and have difficulty to increase walking speed [34]. Impaired ankle power generation combined with saturation of hip power generation limits their potential to increase walking speed, especially in lower function- ing hemiparetic subjects [34]. The abnormalities in the tempo- ral patterning of lower extremity muscle activity have also been well-described in hemiparetic gait [35]. In the upper leg, durations of activity in hamstrings and rectus femoris were significantly pro- longed. In the lower leg, longer total durations of gastrocnemius activity were found. Interestingly most of these disturbances are not limited to the paretic leg, but muscle activation patterns of the non-paretic leg also display some clear abnormalities. Such strong links between paretic and non-paretic side have also been noted in studies during obstacle avoidance in gait [36]. Over time, elec- tromyographic abnormalities change only slightly. In particular, the durations of muscle (co-)activity and the level of swing phase asymmetry does not change much during rehabilitation [37]. In contrast, the level of ambulatory independence, body mobility, and maximum walking speed increases significantly, indicating that substantial improvements in gait ability occur. Apparently, physiological processes other than improved temporal muscular coordination must be important determinants of the restoration of ambulatory capacity after stroke.",

Currently, most efforts include training on a treadmill with or without partial BWS but other physiotherapy approaches have been used as well, with limited success however (e.g. Glasgow Augmented Physiotherapy after Stroke (GAPS) Study Group; [38]). To evaluate the recovery, sev- eral measures have been used such as gait speed or stride length. The benefit of treadmill training has been well documented [39] and it was shown that there is a clear effect of the intensity of the training. Lamontagne and Fung (2004) demonstrated that fast walking on a treadmill induced marked speed-related improve- ments in body and limb kinematics and muscle activation pat- terns [40]. In contrast, BWS during overground walking increased gait speed to a lesser extent and only in low-functioning subjects. Nevertheless, it should be mentioned that one large study showed that locomotor training, including the use of BWS in stepping on a treadmill, was not superior to progressive exercises at home managed by a physical therapist [41].",

However, these adaptations were short-lived (20 min) and, there- fore, the effects of longer-term locomotor retraining still need to be investigated. Similarly, in the future one may expect to see more combinations of treadmill training with dual tasks [43].

The ability to regain sitting balance and trunk control is a core component of stroke rehabilitation, especially early after stroke. Trunk control is more than just sitting balance; it includes selective movements of shoulder and pelvic girdle as well and an important component is counter (i.e. the alternating) rotation between shoulder and pelvic girdle during normal and fast walk- ing. Evidence of effective strategies to improve selective trunk control is scarce. Verheyden and colleagues showed that addi- tional trunk rehabilitation exercises performed in supine and sitting have a beneficial effect on selective trunk movements in a sample of 33 people in the rehabilitation phase after stroke [49]. Saeys et al. provided a similar rehabilitation programme as the previously-mentioned study but for a longer period of time to 33 people in an earlier phase after stroke [50]. Their results showed again beneficial effects on trunk performance, but also on stand- ing balance and mobility. Finally, Karthikbabu and colleagues showed stronger effects of trunk control exercises performed on a dynamic surface (i.e. physio ball) in comparison to the same exercises performed on a static surface (i.e. physio plinth) [51]. The effects were also not just seen in measures of trunk control but in assessments of functional balance as well. Possible reasons of increased effects of dynamic practice are an increased muscle activity with increased demands on (and thus learning of) pos- tural control and voluntary trunk movements, and an increased response to postural",

Normal walking seems easy because it costs less than 50% of the maximal aerobic capacity and does not require anaerobic activity. A hemiparetic gait, however, draws on 75% of the maximal oxygen capacity, leaving little in reserve [52]. To this end, a physical conditioning programme can increase aerobic capacity, but decreasing the walking energy cost is quite challenging because it represents the ambulation task as such and is directly related to gait impairments. Effects on fitness have been assessed, using measures of cardiorespiratory physical fitness and gait endurance [53]. For example, using peak exercise capacity (VO2 peak) and rate of oxygen consumption, studies of treadmill training with or without BWS convincingly showed that treadmill training improves physiological fitness in chronic stroke patients and decreased energy cost by 10% [54, 55].",

Many of these techniques also induced an improve- ment in gait speed; therefore gait assessments after training were often done at higher speed. However, mechanical energy levels and physiological energy cost were found to be higher in subjects with stroke who walked slower, as compared to those who walked faster [57]. When hemiparetic subjects following stroke are instructed to walk at faster speeds, the relative energy cost (per unit of dis- tance travelled) actually decreased, suggesting that faster walking speeds may promote a more cost-effective gait pattern [58]. Indeed, in normal walking a minimum energy cost is reached at interme- diate speeds (\u223c4\u20135 km/h), which is the result of both mechanical factors (better exchange between potential and kinetic energy that reduces the mechanical muscle work) but also metabolic factors (greater efficiency of muscle contraction to provide mechanical work at intermediate speeds).Therefore, patients with pathological gait do not seem to necessarily choose the walking style that mini- mizes their metabolic energy costs. Furthermore, considering that the energy cost decreases with speed up to 4 km/h it is possible that the decrease seen in energy cost after many of the previous treat- ments was simply related to the change in gait speed.

Therefore, the CM vertical excursion is a compensatory strategy and may be increased up to three times more than normal to clear the limb during the swing phase and avoid stumbling. However, this strategy costs two to three times more energy [57]. Interestingly, energy consumption also doubled in able-bodied subjects when provided with a bio- feedback of their CM displacement and asked to walk with exces- sive vertical displacement like stroke patients [59]. It has been postulated that humans would consume the least energy if they walk with their CM flat like a rolling wheel [60]. Hence the con- cept was adopted that fundamentally locomotion is the transla- tion of the CM through space along a pathway requiring the least expenditure of energy. However, healthy Healthy subjects adopt an intermediate strategy of vertical CM displacement (3\u20134 cm at intermediate speeds) that is not as flat as a wheel but that mini- mizes energy consumption [59]. A pilot/feasibility study has thus been carried out in which six stroke patients were trained to decrease their vertical CM displacement with the help of a bio- feedback to see if they could reduce their excessive CM displace- ment and so their energy cost ([61]; see Figure 18.2). The results indeed revealed that after only 6 weeks of training, stroke patients showed a marked decrease in their vertical CM displacement and their energy cost decreased by 30% (that is three times more decrease in three times less time than what has been reported for treadmill alone).

As the patient gets closer to the intermediate optimal strategy that healthy individuals usually adopt, his energy consumption decreased. This suggests that the strategy the patient used before training was not necessarily the cheapest or most effi- cient one. This also contradicts the commonly held notion that a pathological gait may be viewed as an attempt to preserve the lowest level of energy consumption possible by exaggerations of the motions at unaffected levels [60]. It would thus be interesting to see the optimization constraints that may have led the patients to adopt this uneconomical strategy in the beginning.

In SCI patients such facili- tation is much harder to prove because of the large variability.

The use of gait assistance with robotic devices makes this question even more urgent as some of these devices do not allow arm movements to be performed while walk- ing.

Training rules are the same as for any type of training, but one has to be realistic in expectations (because of the presence of brain damage and decreased levels of fitness). For the same reason one should not underestimate the effort needed to relearn motor activity for these patients and adapt the frequency and duration of the training and recovery periods accordingly.",

If the task is to relearn gait, the train- ing should include not only leg movements but also the accom- panying arm swing, walking at different speeds, various terrains, and with or without carrying objects.\n\nRehabilitation can never be seen to be independent of the nat- ural environment of the patients and information about these constraints is thus mandatory for treatment planning. Clinical symptoms, such as spasticity, should not be the main focus of treatment. Rather, it is important to consider the implications of these clinical symptoms for training and the activities to be learned. In this respect it is important to consider the \u2018positive\u2019 value of some of these symptoms (spasticity as used for support for example, co-activation as a means to increase accuracy). Indeed sometimes patients can make use of their spasticity to support their motor actions. Failure to recognize this can lead to disap- pointing functional outcomes of medical treatments that focus mainly on clinical symptoms (surgery, botulinus toxin). Therefore it is recommended to make a complete movement analysis prior to such interventions. Careful assessments, based on advanced 3D recordings of posture and gait, can assist in making proper decisions about planned interventions, aimed at alleviating some clinical symptoms such as spasticity. In cases where spasticity is used to the advantage of the function of the patient, this should be taken into account before antispastic interventions are made.",

In fact, results from only one such trial were recently reported by Duncan and col- leagues, who conducted the LEAPS trial, which tested the effect of locomotor training in 408 people more than 2 months after stroke with a moderate to severe walking deficit [41]. The LEAPS trial included three arms: a group initiating locomotor training by means of BWS and treadmill at 2 months post stroke, a group receiving a home exercise programme at 2 months post stroke, and a control group receiving usual care at 2 months and locomo- tor training at 6 months post stroke. Results showed no significant difference between any of the groups at 12 months post stroke. At 6 months post stroke, both the treadmill and home exercise group yielded significant better results than the control group. Despite non-significant differences between active conditions in the three trials discussed, these trials provide also convincing arguments that active therapy is better than \u2018usual\u2019 care. The challenge for neurorehabilitation after stroke remains to unravel the active and working component of therapy in relation to neurophysiological recovery and translate findings to areas and sample populations which have not profited from large multicentre trials yet.

There was no significant effect on walking velocity or capacity. Heterogeneity of the studies included warrants caution when generalizing these findings. In summary, trials have been conducted where rehabilitation strategies incorporated principles of motor learning but overall, the level of evidence arising from these studies varies and limitations warrant caution when consid- ering generalizability and implementation into clinical practice. Therefore, the different stages of research should be addressed in order to advance knowledge about motor learning in balance and gait rehabilitation after stroke (for a more in-depth discussion about aspects of the research pipeline, see [82]).

Based on these parameters and in combination with surface EMG measurements, classifica- tion studies aim to relate neural damage, control impairment and gross motor function [91, 92]. However, the use of these descrip- tive studies to understand gait impairments has some important limitations [93]. Measuring EMG activity gives information on the relative timing of muscle activations; however it is complicated to relate this directly to individual muscle force. Furthermore, due to dynamic coupling [94] muscles are able to act on joints that they do not span and on segments they are not attached to. It is there- fore difficult to relate the contribution of an individual muscle to the resulting motion of the body (e.g. CM or individual joint angles). To determine causal relationships between muscle activity and the resulting motion, forward simulation studies are needed. Currently, dedicated algorithms (e.g. CMC; [95]) are available that",

When applied on a complex dynamic model, these excitations are able to track experimentally measured kinematics with high accuracy and to reproduce the gait impairments observed in indi- vidual stroke subjects.\n\nStudies by Petersen et al. and Higginson et al. used simulations to investigate how impaired muscle coordination after stroke influences support and progression of the COM during hemiple- gic gait [96\u201398]. They found that during mid stance, both paretic and non-paretic leg plantarflexors contributed less to support than in the speed-matched control subject. This was compensated for by larger paretic leg knee extensors and gluteus maximus con- tributions to support [99]. Peterson et al. also found a decreased contribution of paretic leg plantarflexors and gluteus medius to propulsion during preswing [97]. Even though an increased con- tribution to propulsion was found of non-paretic knee extensors, this was counteracted by a simultaneous increased deceleration contribution of the non-paretic hamstrings. Jansen et al. furthered these insights by comparing the changes in muscle contributions observed in stroke subjects to muscle contributions during asym- metric gait in control subjects walking on a split-belt treadmill [100]. They conclude that the observed contributions in gluteus maximus, knee extensors, plantar-, and dorsiflexors may relate more to the limping-pattern itself, as they were also present dur- ing asymmetric gait in control subjects. However, modulations in gluteus medius and hamstrings found after stroke were different from modulations in split-belt walking, and these are therefore related to concomitant motor deficits.",

Furthermore, the performance of these models in reproducing specific gait impairments was not evaluated.\n\nTo investigate the complexity of the neural control strategy involved in controlling gait, a low-dimensional modular organi- zation of muscle activation was incorporated in simulations of normal gait by using muscle activation modules that drive the muscle excitations [103]. Whereas five modules satisfy the sagit- tal plane biomechanical sub-tasks of 2D walking, a sixth module, which contributes primarily to mediolateral balance control and contralateral leg swing, is needed to account for the non-sagittal plane demands of 3D walking [104, 105]. These results provide evidence that a simple neural control strategy involving muscle activation modules may be used to control gait in healthy con- trol subjects. Experimentally, it is confirmed that stroke subjects rely on fewer muscle activation modules that are composed from merging modules observed in healthy controls. However, so far, it could not be confirmed that imposing these reduced number of activation modules is likely to induce hemiparetic gait features. These simulations would confirm that the reduced independence of neural control signals contributes to the specific gait impair- ments observed in stroke subjects.",

For example, currently high expec- tations are present with respect to new methods such as tDCS (transcranial direct current stimulation). This technique generates a wide scientific interest nowadays, probably because of the fact that the application of tDCS is relatively easy and simple, not overly expensive, has little to no adverse effects and shows potential to improve motor outcome after stroke. In fact, its application may go wider. For example, many patients who have stroke will have small vessel disease and leukoaraiosis, leading to gait apraxia. Recent evi- dence suggests that combined anodal tDCS and physical therapy improves gait and balance in this patient group, suggesting that tDCS could be an effective tool in patients with leukoaraiosis, for whom no treatment is currently available [107].",

Lesions can be focal, as in most cases of traumatic aetiology, or multifo- cal or generalized as commonly seen in non-traumatic causes. Current therapy aims at reversing the underlying cause of the nerve lesion, whilst at the same time, treat symptoms such as pain that may arise as a consequence of the lesion. In the case of traumatic lesions, surgery may be considered to remove the insult (such as nerve compression) or repair the nerve, to thereby facili- tate the process of nerve regeneration. As such, the focus of this chapter relates to rehabilitation in patients diagnosed with lesions affecting the PNS. Depending on the nature of the underlying dis- order, treatment goals are directed at the maintenance of strength and function, particularly in disorders that are reversible, or in the case of chronic disease, to prevent the progression of weakness and thereby resultant disability.",

    "text": "Traumatic lesions of the peripheral nervous system Trauma disrupts the structural integrity of the axon and its sur- rounding myelin sheath. Traumatic nerve lesions may induce scattered damage, with distal axonal degeneration (Wallerian degeneration), a process known as axonotmesis [1] . In such an instance, regeneration of axons from the lesion site to the target is required before full clinical recovery may develop. However, a shorter period of recovery may be possible in the case of collateral sprouting and reinnervation for partial lesions [2]. Neurotmesis involves lesions of the entire nerve and its supportive sheath, that usually requires nerve grafting for effective treatment, although tends to have a poor prognosis with only partial recovery [1]. On the other hand, neuropraxia has a better prognosis as there is no loss of axonal continuity [2], although typically there is conduction block at the lesion site determined by electrophysiological studies (e.g. compressive lesions such as ulnar neuropathy at the elbow or peroneal neuropathy at the fibular neck). Neuropraxis may induce focal demyelination at the site of trauma with subsequent",

The natural history of neuropathy is dependent on the underly- ing aetiology, with acute neuropathies such as acute inflamma- tory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome) reaching their maximal deficit acutely, followed by gradual recovery. Conversely, chronic inflammatory demyeli- nating polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) tends to relapse and remit, or gradually deteriorate over years (e.g. hereditary motor sensory neuropathy and alcohol-related neuropathy). The most common presentation for peripheral neuropathies is a symmetri- cal length-dependent polyneuropathy with variable sensory and motor components, depending on the aetiology. Most peripheral neuropathies begin by first affecting sensory nerve fibres, with gradual involvement of motor axons as the disease progresses. There are certain disorders, however, that only have motor involve- ment, such as multifocal motor neuropathy and some forms of inherited distal motor neuropathies.",

The unpleasant sensation may be constant, intermittent, lancinating, burning, tingling, crawling or electrical in character [7] . The management of neuropathic pain is based on four physiological processes involved in the pain expe- rience, namely transduction, transmission, modulation and per- ception [7].

Over a 6-week period, the overall loss was estimated as 48% of baseline strength, averaging approximately 8% per week [14]. Non-denervated mus- cles, which may be part of the affected limb, may also reduce in size as a result of disuse, although the extent is usually not as pronounced as those in neurogenic atrophy.

In the context of peripheral nerve disorders, the development of fatigue may be multifactorial: impaired muscular activation, generalized deconditioning, and diminished cardiopulmonary performance due to immobility [17, 18].\n\nJoint and soft tissue changes The equilibrium between intravascular and interstitial fluid vol- umes is maintained partly through contraction of skeletal muscles [7] . Following peripheral nerve lesions, immobility of the limb, and associated changes in local circulation, resultant oedema may develop [8]. Once chronic oedema develops, collagen formation and fibrosis may ensue, leading to joint stiffness and contractures [8, 21]. In addition, collagen biosynthesis increases following den- ervation, with tightening of the ordinarily loose meshwork that surrounds myofibres [7].",

The resultant increase in limb tone will contribute to muscle shortening and the development of contrac- tures, thereby worsening the functional impairment, often associ- ated with pain.",

Bottom, novel machine with vibrating base for more advanced balance training using vibratory perturbations.\n\nA problem commonly encountered with electrical stimulation relates to accelerated fatigue during training. This is likely to be attributed to physiological differences in temporal and spatial recruitment of motor units between voluntary and electrically stimulated contractions. Transcutaneous electrical stimulation will recruit the same population of muscle fibres synchronously (i.e. those closest to the stimulating electrodes) [71], whereas voluntary contractions recruit motor units asynchronously [72, 73]. Specifically, electrically stimulated contractions require a non-physiological, extremely high firing rate to maintain smooth tetanus and therefore, a higher energy demand, making such inter- ventions prone to rapid fatigue. Synaptic recruitment of motor units can be enhanced through modifying stimulation param- eters including: stimulating over the peripheral nerve rather than muscle belly, using higher frequencies (e.g. 100 Hz), longer pulse duration (e.g. 1 ms), and low stimulation intensity to minimize antidromic block [74\u201377]. Synaptic recruitment of motoneurons resembles the recruitment pattern that underlies voluntary con- traction, and may produce the most fatigue-resistant contractions [75, 76, 78]. However, the effectiveness of this type of stimulation paradigm remains to be validated through future longitudinal training studies and clinical trials.",

Because of the limited number of human studies and the heterogeneity in the stimulation protocols used, there is currently no consensus amongst clinicians with respect to the most appropriate stimula- tion protocol. For this reason, there is currently insufficient evi- dence to support or refute the use of NMES in the rehabilitation of peripheral nerve disorders.

    "text": "The 2nd European Federation of Neurological Societies Task Force (EFNS) [116] guidelines on the pharmacological treatment of neuropathic pain, have recommended tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; e.g. amitriptyline and nortriptyline), gabapentin, pregaba- lin, and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs; e.g. duloxetine, venlafaxine), as first line treatment (level A). Tramadol (level A) is recommended as second line except for exacerbations of pain, and third line agents include stronger opioids such as oxy- codone. Other options to consider include nitrate derivatives and nicotinic agonists, and topical agents such as lidocaine and capsa- icin [116]. More recently, researches have studied the use intrader- mal injection of botulinum toxin type A for the treatment diabetic neuropathic pain. Results have shown that injection into multiple sites of the feet produced a good response in terms of pain reduc- tion [117]. The mechanism of action may be through the inhibition of glutamate release by nociceptive afferents. If proven effective in phase III trials, the toxin can be a useful adjunct in the manage- ment for patients with focal neuropathic pain.",

    "text": "Electrical stimulation Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is com- monly used in the management of many acute and chronic pain conditions such rheumatoid arthritis [118], chronic low back pain [119, 120], and pain during labour [121]. TENS treatment is rarely associated with adverse side effects and has been shown to be effective in patients with neuropathic pain [122\u2013124]. It is thought that repetitive stimulation activates descending pain inhibitory system and the spinal gating mechanism to produce an analgesic effect. Two main stimulation parameters are used clinically: high-frequency (100 Hz) at intensity just below motor threshold or low-frequency (<20 Hz) set at an intensity above motor threshold [125, 126]. Low-frequency TENS has been shown to be a promising treatment option for symptomatic diabetic neu- ropathy [127], trigeminal neuralgia [128], and neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury [124, 129]. TENS is an inexpensive and non-invasive treatment that can be self-administered and may be included as an adjunct to pharmacotherapy in the management of neuropathic pain [130].",

On initial examination, the patient had complete paralysis of the right biceps, deltoids, and triceps, whilst moder- ate weakness was present in the wrist extensors and flexors, and as well as the intrinsic hand muscles. Deep tendon reflexes of the right biceps and brachioradialis were absent. Sensory examination revealed numbness involving the upper arm and forearm, and the patient complained of persistent pins and needles in the right hand. A magnetic resonance image of the right brachial plexus and cervical spine demonstrated perineural oedema around all three trunks of the brachial plexus, consistent with neuropraxia likely caused by a traction injury.",

Furthermore, inability to participate in active exercise rehabilitation may con- tribute to the development of joint stiffness and pain later. Whilst the neuropraxia itself may take up to several months to recover, rehabilitation of the shoulder must begin immediately in order to maximise functionality and prevent complications such as muscle wasting and contractures, particularly in the context of the recent shoulder replacement.",

Maintain cardiovascular fitness and improve strength\n\nRehabilitation strategy and rationale\n\nIn this case, the use of NMES is ideal to activate the weak mus- cles such as the biceps, triceps, deltoids and the wrist extensors. Electrical stimulation can be delivered directly over the motor points of the muscles or over the peripheral nerves that inner- vate these muscles. Peripheral nerve stimulation (especially at high frequencies) may also promote neuroplasticity and is less prone to training fatigue. During NMES training, the patient was encouraged to \u2018try\u2019 and contract the same muscles being stimu- lated or at the very least, \u2018imagine\u2019 contracting the same muscles. Active strengthening exercises for the unaffected left arm takes place concurrently to maximise the \u2018cross education\u2019 effect.",

The main goals are to gradually improve range\n\nof motion of passive and active shoulder flexion and abduction, as well as internal and external rotation of the glenohumeral joint. Passive stretches involving sustained static holds are most effective when performed by a therapist. The patient must also perform active shoulder flexion, abduction and rotation ROM exercises at home daily. These can be performed with the assis- tance of the unaffected arm or using props such as a broomstick or stretch bands (Figure 19.7). In addition, ROM of the elbow, wrist, and fingers were monitored regularly.",

The inability to incorporate an upper limb in activities of daily living has an enormous impact on an individual\u2019s ability to live independently. Neurorehabilitation has traditionally adopted a holistic approach in order to help a person acquire the knowl- edge and skills needed for optimum physical, psychological, and social function.

In contrast to patients with stroke and C-SCI, patients with MS may show temporal fluctuations in impairment or may exhibit a progressive course, and their upper limb symptoms may be either unilateral or bilat- eral. For these reasons, direct translation of findings from upper limb neurorehabilitation studies in stroke or C-SCI patients is not straightforward. A recent systematic review of motor train- ing programmes of arm and hand in MS patients found that over- all, most studies demonstrated improvements in upper limb in medical stable MS patients with different degrees of severity [16]. However, a consensus on the optimal content of upper limb train- ing programmes for patients with MS is lacking.",

Initial severity of upper limb impairment and function are the most significant predictors of upper limb recov- ery [6]. Between 33% to 66% of stroke patients with an initially paretic upper limb do not show any recovery in upper limb func- tion 6 months after stroke [4, 5]. Patients showing some (synergis- tic) movement in the upper limb within 4 weeks post stroke had a greater than 90% chance of improving, whereas this probability remained below 10% in those who failed to show any return of motor control [2]. These data have been used to argue that after stroke there is a critical period for aggressive neurorehabilitation particularly when it comes to upper limb function [7].",

The crucial ques- tions of when is best to deliver a treatment and who is most likely to benefit are largely unanswered [17]. In future, clinical trials of rehabilitation strategies might cross disease boundaries to develop and test the most optimal methods for training patients based on impairments and disabilities rather than diseases [18].

Patients with MS\n\nGeneral approaches to upper limb therapy There is an appreciation that neurorehabilitation strategies that aim to restore as much arm and hand function as possible do not provide adequate dose or intensity of treatment [7] . A recent study determined that during inpatient rehabilitation patients were engaged in activities with the potential to prevent compli- cations and improve recovery of mobility only 13% of the time, and were alone over 60% of the time [19]. Furthermore, practice of task-specific, functional upper-extremity movements occurred in only 51% of the rehabilitation sessions that were meant to address upper-limb rehabilitation [20]. There is conflicting evidence about whether providing additional upper limb therapy improves out- comes, but the design of many studies investigating this question varies quite significantly, and so inconsistent results are not sur- prising. For example, it is likely that the amount of extra ther- apy is important but ranges from 2 hours per week to 3 hours a day. Furthermore, extra treatment was sometimes initiated early",

It is possi- ble that there is threshold for activity below which motor recovery is unlikely to occur [28]. In human stroke patients, the typical number or repetitions in a therapy session is much lower, approxi- mately 30 [20].

It is hoped that the use of robots in guid- ing highly specific training regimes will allow a sufficient number of repetitions to be delivered [40, 41]. Robotic devices also offer the prospect of very detailed assessment of changes in motor control [42]. Most clinical trials have been small and have involved chronic stroke patients. Overall, there is evidence of improvement in the Fugl-Meyer score of 2\u20134 points when compared to usual care [43], which falls below the level of a clinically meaningful change [44]. In one of the largest studies to date, chronic stroke patients with a Fugl-Meyer score of between 7 and 38 (range 0\u201366) were included. The robotic treatment did achieve a large number of repetitions (over 1,000 per session), but the Fugl-Meyer score only improved by just over 2 points compare to usual (less intense) therapy, and was no different to therapy matched for dose [45]. Others have argued that this intensity of therapy needs to be delivered much earlier than 6 months post stroke [7, 46], and it may also be that certain sub- groups of patients would be more likely to benefit [47, 48], but this is currently not clear. There are a number of devices available and these are discussed in detail elsewhere in this book (Chapter 31). The relationship between robotic technology and motor learning is also addressed in detail elsewhere in this book (Chapter 7).",

Two meta-analyses of strength training of the upper limb after stroke concluded that there was evidence to support a positive effect on grip strength, but also on upper limb function and activity, with- out adverse effects on spasticity or pain [51, 52].\n\nIt has been argued that increases in muscle strength may not translate into improvements in functional activity unless strength- ening activity is provided as part of training of everyday func- tional activities [53]. Muscle strength training can be combined with functional training. The resulting functional strength train- ing (FST) emphasizes improving the power of shoulder and elbow muscles to enable appropriate placing of the hand and improving the production of appropriate force in different muscles to achieve a specific grasp. Preliminary data from a phase II trial suggest that FST may be more effective than standard therapy of equal inten- sity [54] and a larger trial is underway [55].",

Sensory impair- ment is associated with slower recovery after stroke because it is important for motor function. Although many of the approaches described incorporate sensory stimulation with motor training, there have been specific attempts to examine whether additional sensory training can influence motor recovery. Systematic reviews have generally included a wide variety of techniques including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), acupuncture, thermal stimulation, repetitive passive movement therapy, inter- mittent pneumatic compression, and learning based sensorimo- tor training [59]. Each may have a different mechanism of action and so evaluating the effect of these therapies together may not be appropriate. Currently, there is insufficient evidence to support or refute effectiveness of these sensory interventions in improving sensory impairment, upper limb function, or participants\u2019 func- tional status and participation after stroke [59].",

First, patients are required to wear a sling or mitten restricting use of the unaffected hand/arm (Figure 20.1). Second, increased use of the affected hand/arm in functional tasks, a form of train- ing that has been termed \u2018shaping\u2019. This approach was first intro- duced in 1994 after Taub and colleagues [60] noted that monkeys with a peripherally deafferented upper limb did not use the affected limb even after neurological injury had resolved. They proposed that \u2018excess\u2019 motor disability could be caused through negative reinforcement and learned nonuse and that changing the contingencies of reinforcement could lead to improvement in limb function. The biological mechanisms underpinning CIMT in those with damage to the central nervous system (compared to peripheral deafferentation) are unclear. Indeed, whether learned nonuse is a major contributor to \u2018excess motor disability\u2019 after stroke is unproven, partly because learned nonuse cannot be measured. Furthermore, the relative contributions of increas- ing the amount of affected limb practice and constraining the unaffected side, are not known. Nevertheless, CIMT has been widely studied.",

Although there is little evidence that CIMT leads to either sig- nificant reductions in impairment or a return to closer to normal levels of motor control [63], it appears to be able to improve some aspects of motor function over and above standard care. Function may improve through learning to compensate for deficits better by practicing particular tasks using intact residual capacities.

Bilateral arm function is important because much of what we do every day involves the use of both arms. Recovery of bilat- eral arm function is best facilitated through training of both arms together rather than separately, since different mechanisms are involved in unilateral and bilateral arm movement [68, 69]. However, it is also suggested that practising bilateral activities may have a positive effect on unilateral (affected) arm function, although the justification is usually in terms of neurophysiologi- cal changes perceived as being beneficial (i.e. reduced intracorti- cal inhibition and/or increased intracortical facilitation affected hemisphere motor cortex [70]).",

The effects of centrally act- ing antispasticity medication tend to be limited by side effects such as muscle weakness and sedation and so physical therapies together with botulinum toxin are the most commonly used treatments.\n\nThe use of splinting to counteract or prevent spasticity in the upper limb is common, but a recent systematic review exam- ined four trials including 126 stroke patients and found no evi- dence that upper limb orthoses improve upper limb function, range of movement at the wrist, fingers, or thumb, nor pain [110]. Another commonly used approach is to use stretching regimes, and one study has shown some benefit in terms of increasing joint angles, reducing pain and improving activities of daily living in chronic stroke patients [111] but there is less evidence in the early post-stroke phase [112]. One of the problems with trials in both splinting and stretching is that the optimum dose is not clear and one solution to this that is routinely employed is to encourage patients or carers to perform stretching themselves.",

It appears to be safer, better tolerated and more effective than tizanidine in treating upper limb spasticity [114]. Two early systematic reviews supported the finding that botuli- num toxin is effective at reducing spasticity and improving pas- sive range of movement, but not upper limb function [115, 116]. Another systematic review, however, reported a relationship between the maximum change in spasticity and the maximum change in arm function suggesting that reduction in spasticity is associated with improved arm function [117]. This supported by a systematic review of 16 trials, which found that the use of botulinum toxin was associated with moderate improvement in upper-extremity performance after stroke [118].",

Patients with severe impairment beyond several months have less chance for restoration of normal motor function, although improve- ment of function through compensatory strategies is certainly possible. Those with less severe impairment, for example pres- ervation of activity in the elbow, wrist and/or finger extensors, are more likely to have the necessary neural infrastructure to support further recovery. There is increasing evidence that the first few months are a critical period, with greater potential for recovery, possibly through enhanced neuroplastic processes. Resources should be maximally directed at patients in these first few months.

    "text": "There are many approaches being investigated, but all too often the studies are too small, or they have not employed reasonable patient stratification based on an understanding of the mecha- nisms involved. It is clear that at present there is no clear idea, who each of these approaches is best suited to. Currently, treat- ment approaches such as CIMT or motor imagery are used on an ad hoc basis. Future strategies require studies at all stages of the translational pipeline [134] in order to understand how interven- tions work, who they wo11.339 ptk best in, what the clinical effects of these interventions are, and whether they can be delivered on a large scale in diverse healthcare systems.",

Together with functional activities of daily living (ADL) performance, age and gender, aphasia leads to reduced long-term social participation [2]. Yet in spite of its high inci- dence aphasia is still a hidden disability, isolating patients and relatives. A third of aphasic stroke patients have associated depression 12 months after their stroke [3\u20135]. As such apha- sia is one of the most feared consequences of stroke accord- ing to surveys of those who are most at risk [6] and persisting aphasia correlates with poor health outcomes [7]. Therefore, effective aphasia treatment approaches are urgently needed. The major acquired disease categories in terms of aetiological cause are: (1) acquired focal brain injury, we will use stroke as the archetypical example but tumours, and to some extent, head injury, can also present in a similar manner; (2) degenera- tive diseases, primary progressive aphasia is often cited as the archetypical example, but Alzheimer\u2019s disease is much more common and is often associated with aphasic symptoms, such as word finding problems (anomia).",

We agree with the first step but question the utility of the second on both con- ceptual and practical grounds. Conceptually the case for the \u2018double-dissociation\u2019 between Broca\u2019s (primarily an output disor- der, with impaired grammar) and Wernicke\u2019s aphasia (primarily a disorder of speech comprehension at the lexico/semantic level, often associated with a jargon output) is weak, and the similari- ties, in terms of error frequency and type, are often as striking as the differences [15]. On the practical side, diagnostic tests designed to categorize patients to help guide therapy, such as the Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination [16] or Western Aphasia Battery [17], have poor agreement with clustering algorithms [18]. Recent attempts to revamp these aphasia syndrome classifications have perhaps created more heat than light [19].",

For example, in the domain of speech production, a naming deficit may be described broadly as anomia, or more precisely e.g., as a disruption involved in the linking of semantic information with its corresponding phonological word form. Diagnostic testing can be based on the theoretical view that the spoken word production system consists of multiple stages of processing that allow word semantics, lexical retrieval, phonemic encoding and motor production to be distin- guished from one another e.g., for a review see [24]. Given this, the diagnostic work for characterizing speech deficits would involve testing hearing, auditory language comprehension, object nam- ing, word fluency, and repetition. Spoken naming can be further evaluated to determine error profiles. For example, are naming errors phonemic (e.g. the patient says /mat/ when asked to name a picture of a cat); or semantic (e.g. /dog/ for cat)? Are subjects helped by phonological cueing (e.g. after failing to name the picture of the cat, when given the first sound /ca/ do they name it correctly)? The reasoning is as follows: intact auditory comprehension rules out a semantic deficit, good repetition rules out motor speech prob- lems and only mild (if any) apraxia of speech, whereas difficulties with picture naming, decreased fluency, production of semantic errors, and sensitivity to phonemic cueing point to a disruption in the link between word meaning and word form. In addition, a more comprehensive evaluation of related language and cognitive abilities will include tests of written language, short-term memory (verbal and visual), attention and executive functions. To capture speech production beyond the single word",

For example, in the CAT the patient\u2019s spoken picture description over a one minute period is transcribed and then ana- lysed using measures such as the number of appropriate and inap- propriate information carrying words (both nouns and verbs), as well more global variables such as syntactic variety and gram- matical well-formedness [20]. Almost all aphasic patients have an anomic component, and a classification of their naming errors (phonological, semantic, jargon, absent response) and the type of cueing they best respond to (phonological or semantic), can help characterize what level within a model of language processing the patient\u2019s speech deficit is and then guide therapy and monitor the patient\u2019s progress and response to SALT.",

While working memory and processing speed tend to decrease with advancing age, some forms of memory remain static or even increase (e.g. vocabulary), which relies in part on semantic memory [61].

The TMS findings from placebo-controlled trials (n = 4 to date) [68\u201371] have collectively found inhibitory rTMS to the right Broca\u2019s area homologue effec- tive in the treatment of non-fluent aphasia. Whereas tDCS as an adjunct to SALT treatment for aphasia has been applied to the perilesional left hemisphere [72\u201376] or non-dominant right hemi- sphere [77\u201379] as a treatment of speech production and compre- hension impairments. Each of these two techniques brings with them a set of relative advantages and disadvantages that may affect their potential wider clinical use. We direct the interested read- ers to a recent special issue of Aphasiology for details about both and their application to aphasia [80]. Particular focus in clinical trials is now on tDCS as it is portable, non-expensive, regarded as safe (lower risk of seizures than TMS) and involves a relatively simple set-up. These features together with the fact it can easily be delivered concurrently with SALT without adversely affecting the patient make tDCS a putative candidate for home treatment as an add-on to behavioural training or substitutive therapy for pharmacological treatments. Applying stimulation during SALT has the potential to influence both the immediate language per- formance and the consolidation phases of relearning. Using these NIBS methods in clinical practice could bring enormous gains for the treatment of aphasia in the future.",

    "text": "Drug therapy Unfortunately the Cochrane review of drug therapy for aphasia is not helpful in assessing the evidence here [81]. Published in 2001 and yet to be updated, they searched for studies from 1966 to 1998, finding over 300 abstracts from which they extracted 55 studies. 45 of these were rejected on methodological grounds, and of the 10 remaining in the review, \u2018only one trial reported sufficient detail for analysis (abstract)\u2019. A quantitative meta-analysis based on only one trial is clearly not useful. A recent dedicated special issue of Aphasiology, Volume 28, issue 2 (Special Issue: Pharmacology and Aphasia) (2014), provides a more rounded update on the surpris- ing amount of studies published on this topic over many decades. We recommend this to interested parties as a full review is beyond the scope of this chapter. Overall, many different classes of drug have been tried with roughly half of the studies pairing a drug with behavioural therapy in an attempt to boost language relearn- ing. The rationale behind those studies that did not pair drugs with SALT is that the drug will provide a simple main effect of general improvement in speech and language function that presumably will be lost if the drug were to be stopped (a tonic effect). Over half of the literature reports single-case studies or small case series (hence they don\u2019t meet the criteria for Cochrane), such studies are not necessarily unhelpful but care needs to be taken with study design as they can be plagued by bias. The better ones include a form of control (placebo if possible) which means the patient(s)",

Lastly, it is often useful to have a drug holiday or final block where the drug is withdrawn. If the theory is that the drug is having a tonic effect on language behaviour, then performance should drop off when the drug is stopped (thus providing evidence that, if effective, patients need to remain on it indefinitely).

Unfortunately, the commonest form has been bromocriptine (an ergot derived dopamine agonist) that is not used much by move- ment disorder specialists as it can cause long-term problems with lung and cardiac fibrosis. The other drug to be trialed in this class is L-dopa. The overall evidence is mixed, with about half of all published studies showing a beneficial effect of dopamin- ergic therapy. Dopamine, as might be expected, has an effect on the motor system per se so with some of the studies it is difficult to disentangle purely motoric effects from linguistic ones [82]. The study that provides the best evidence that L-dopa improves language learning was actually carried out in healthy controls. Knecht et al. used a randomized double-blind and parallel-group design in 40 subjects. L-dopa was used in a phasic way, paired with a computer-delivered task that required subjects to learn a novel vocabulary (nouns) associated with pictures of familiar objects. One group got L-dopa and the other placebo, 90 minutes prior to high-frequency, repetitive training. L-dopa significantly enhanced the speed, overall success, and long-term retention of novel word learning in a dose-dependent manner [83]. The most recent posi- tive study in aphasic patients used a very similar approach to Knecht\u2019s pairing L-dopa or placebo with 15 daily computer-based therapy sessions. The main effect was of practice, with the pla- cebo group improving on confrontation naming by 25% and the L-dopa group by 35% (a statistically non-significant difference).

An individual with expressive aphasia may have difficulties creating a complete sentence when ordering what they want at a restaurant.

In the case of an aphasic with speech problems an AAC device can be used to supplement their existing speech or replace non-functional speech by provid- ing vocabulary words, phrases and sentences on topics (e.g. food) when they have trouble finding the words that they want to say.

Stroke has a variable effect across patients and recovery is clearly dependent on several key factors that are either intrinsic (site of lesion, cognition) or extrinsic (time, therapy) to the indi- vidual; these factors necessarily interact, but what are the impor- tant ones? As mentioned, age itself is not one but initial severity is clearly important. As Anna Basso remarked in an early review of the topic which focused on demographic variables and found no role for age, sex or handedness: \u2018The factors that really do influence outcome are initial severity of aphasia (which is inextricably asso- ciated with the extent and the location of the lesion) and rehabili- tation\u2019 [89]. Almost all surviving stroke patients improve over time and as well as tracing these \u2018natural\u2019 recovery curves, we also wish to be able to predict the effect of therapy on these curves; that is, to identify why some patients respond better to a given therapy dose than others [90]. Some work has already been done on this and cognitive factors such as working memory [91], and a combination of attention, semantic memory, and phonological skills [92] have been found to be important. The main challenge, which is now becoming tractable, is to investigate how demographic, cognitive, and neural factors interact to determine response to therapy.",

Top Stroke Rehabil. 2003;10(2):66\u201376.\n\nCurrent research is working towards identifying neural factors that may be useful in predicting the recovery of aphasic stroke patients or may influence their treatment. Both the structural and functional anatomy of the aphasic stroke patient\u2019s brain will be important. For example, knowing where the lesion is and what per- ilesional tissue is anatomically intact is critical for identifying which part of the brain to stimulate when using NIBS to augment SALT. Knowing the residual functional connectivity may help explain why patients with seemingly similar lesions vary in both their base- line severity, and in their recovery over time [93]. Lesion location is clearly an important factor in this. Structural brain imaging con- tains a wealth of complex information, but when this is reduced to a single number, such as the volume of tissue damaged by the stroke, the prognostic value becomes useless [94]. Advances in computer processing power have meant that much more detailed multivari- ate analyses of imaging and behavioural data are now possible [95]. This means that the location, shape and number of regions included in the lesion can be factored into prediction algorithms along with behavioural measures. Many of the studies addressing prediction to date have opted for a binarized outcome (\u2018good\u2019 versus \u2018poor\u2019); however, we question the utility of this for both patients and thera- pists. It is likely to be much more informative to predict recovery trajectories on a continuous measure of outcome. Although more technically challenging, this is possible [96] (see Figure 21.4).",

The patients would be carefully characterized in terms of their behavioural measures, along with structural and possibly functional brain imaging. The intervention would be targeted at either their impairment or aimed to improve social participation, preferably both; and would be delivered at a high enough dose. The patients would have been involved in the development of the intervention, and perhaps even its funding. Perhaps a cognitive enhancer (NIBS or drug therapy) would be added into the design. If the study proves successful, then a trans- lational plan will be in place so that current and future patients may benefit from any positive findings. If that sounds futuristic, think again, as William Gibson says, \u2018The future is already here\u2014 it\u2019s just not very evenly distributed\u2019 [97].",

Independent of the function that has to be trained, intensive training is critical. It has been used successfully to improve language functions and has invoked methods such as constraint-induced therapy in aphasia [5] or computer training for anomia [6]. Spatial attention in hemispatial neglect or spatial alexia may benefit from repetitive exploration through intensive training [7, 8]. In some situations, the exploitation of physiological principles improves cognitive functions. For example, neck-muscle vibration or prism-adaptation improve spatial exploration in hem- ispatial neglect. However, lasting effects generally require the cou- pling of such manipulations with active, intensive training [9].",

Similarly, the effects of electrical or magnetic stimulation have varied.

Memory is a complex function that involves dis- tinct cognitive processes related to how information is registered (encoding), how it is rendered stable (consolidation), how memory traces are accessed (retrieval), and how traces related to distinct events are distinguished (source memory). In addition, the term \u2018memory\u2019 relates to several, largely independent systems that may be distinguished based on whether content is accessed consciously (explicit versus implicit memory), whether learning is abrupt or incremental (declarative versus procedural memory), or whether memory contents are linked to a spatiotemporal context (episodic versus semantic memory). Patients with severe memory problems may have largely intact performance in procedural learning, clas- sical conditioning or priming, and some of these capacities are relevant for memory rehabilitation [15\u201317].",

Conversely, prefrontal cortex damage may particularly affect acquisition and recall of information due to the importance of this region for encoding and strategic organisation of retrieval. Orbitofrontal damage may induce an inability to sense whether evoked memories relate to present reality, as evidenced in con- fabulation and disorientation [18, 19].",

    "text": "Acqusition of new memory contents The traditional method to improve acquisition and retention of new information, that is, to compensate for anterograde amnesia, in patients with memory problems are mnemonics, such as build- ing an acronym or creating rhymes [20]. However, most of these techniques are inflexible and can only be used for very specific material. In addition, mnemonics rely on a systematic effort and are therefore only of use for patients with relatively slight memory impairment [21] while patients with severe impairment do better only when new information is presented in a special format (e.g. a word combined with a picture [22]). Some mnemonic strategies use visual imagery, and one of the rare randomized studies in the domain of memory rehabilitation compared systematic training of visual imagery during encoding with a \u2018pragmatic\u2019 therapy including face-name associations and the use of memory note- books [23]. Each group consisted of 12 patients who were trained for 30 sessions. Imagery training started with simple exercises (imaging of single objects), went gradually through more diffi- cult tasks (imaging of actions) and ended with transfer to the use of imagery in everyday situations. Imagery training resulted in improved retention of stories and appointments and better ratings of everyday memory by the relatives (Figure 22.1). Thus, this study shows that systematic training of an \u2018internal\u2019 mnemonic tech- nique can have beneficial effects on everyday memory function. Such techniques have therefore been recommended for patients with mild to moderate memory problems [24, 25].",

    "text": "special format in order to enhance retention. Glisky et al. [26] presented computer-related terms (a simplified programming language allowing patients to process forms by interacting with a computer) while gradually diminishing the number of letters con- situting each word. This \u2018vanishing cues\u2019 technique lead to slow, incremental learning and eventually resulted in correct retention across several weeks or months. However, learning was labori- ous (memory-impaired patients required many more trials than healthy subjects), and the success at retrieval strongly depended on whether recall was tested in conditions similar to acquisition or not [27]. This latter finding suggests that new knowledge acquired using the vanishing cues technique is hyperspecific, mainly asso- ciative, largely inflexible and possibly depends on implicit memory systems [28]. An additional problem with the technique is that it promotes the production of errors, which is particularly deleteri- ous in patients with impaired memory. The reason is that actively produced errors during learning may remain activated in implicit memory and therefore re-emerge whenever the patient attempts to access a specific memory content. Baddeley and Wilson [29] there- fore suggested that memory rehabilitation should use techniques that, whenever possible, eliminate errors (\u2018errorless learning\u2019). Several studies have demonstrated an advantage of errorless learn- ing as compared to conditions that did not prevent wrong answers. This applies to the acquisition of verbal associations [30, 31] or the learning of more complex procedural knowledge [32]. Overall the effect size of interventions using errorless learning is higher com- pared to the vanishing cues technique [33].",

In activities of daily living memory expresses itself often in the ability to remember to do things at a particular moment in time (prospective memory) [36]. It seems straightforward that prospective memory is best sup- ported by external memory aids and agendas; however, system- atic use of a notebook may prove extremely difficult for patients with severe memory problems who never used external memory aids before injury [37, 38]. A systematic training programme is therefore necessary that divides training into an acquisition phase (learning to know the function of the agenda), an application phase (exercises how to note fake or real appointments), and a transfer phase (use of the agenda in everyday life) [37, 39, 40].",

    "text": "Spatial neglect Spatial neglect is a significant predictor of prolonged hospital stay, worse recovery of motor and sensory function, and greater dependence in activities of daily living [49, 50]. The rehabilitation of spatial neglect has therefore received special attention. Initial studies have focused on the deficits of contralesional awareness and involved systematic training of visual scanning, reading and reorienting of attention [51, 52]. These studies revealed positive effects of training on classic neglect measures (cancellation, line bisection, reading, etc.), but lacked adequate control and follow-up measures. These findings have also been criticized for the lack of effect on neglect expressed in activities of daily living [53]. More recent studies have examined the impact of diverse physiologi- cal modulations, and some of these have reported significant and lasting effects on standard neglect measures as well as independ- ence in everyday life. Dramatic attenuation of neglect may be observed under caloric stimulation with cold water, but the effect is short-lived (approximately 15 min) and not well tolerated [54]. Schindler et al. [9] examined the effect of neck muscle vibration on neglect recovery in a cross-over design. Vibratory stimulation of the neck muscles at 80\u2013100 Hz mimics a head-turn contralat- eral to vibration and thus biases perceived head-on-trunk signals. During 2 weeks (15 sessions) one group of 10 neglect patients received visual exploration training combined with neck mus- cle vibration, followed by 2 weeks of exploration training alone. The other group received the same treatment in reversed order. Both groups showed improved performance in cancellation, tac- tile exploration, reading, and",

    "text": "Another technique that is thought to have effects by recalibrat- ing the biased egocentric reference frame in neglect is prismatic adaptation. This technique requires patients to point to visual tar- gets while wearing prismatic goggles that deviate the field of view\n\nby 10\u201315 degrees to the right. This deviation introduces an error signal between the perceived position and the actual position of the target that must be compensated by pointing further to the left. This compensatory effect is evidenced following adaptation, where pointing is biased to the left after removal of the prisms. Rossetti et al. [55] showed that a single session of prismatic adap- tation (50\u201360 pointing movements) had positive effects on spatial neglect immediately following adaptation and even better effects two hours later. A more systematic study [56] revealed beneficial effects on neglect symptoms up to 5 weeks following the therapy. More recently Serino et al. [57] tested the effects of prismatic adaptation in a randomized controlled trial involving 20 neglect patients. Ten patients were adapted during 10 sessions while the other 10 patients exercised pointing with non-prismatic goggles. Results showed a specific effect of prismatic adaptation on diverse measures of neglect, but no effect of pointing without prisms.",

    "text": "Although these results are encouraging, some findings preclude unconditional recommendation of prismatic adaptation therapy. First, Rousseaux et al. [58] failed to replicate the initial resuls of Rossetti et al. [55], suggesting that a single session of adaptation may not be sufficient to improve neglect. Turton et al. [59] used a very similar design as the study of Serino et al. [57] and observed comparable improvement of neglect after prismatic adaptation and neutral pointing. The main difference between these two studies was that Turton et al. [59] tested patients at earlier stages of the disease while Serino et al. [57] included patients with chronic neglect. It is therefore possible that prismatic adaptation acts dif- ferently in post-acute and chronic neglect. A recent meta-analysis [60] has shown that prismatic adaptation has significant posi- tive effects immediately after the end of the therapy (mean effect size: 0.89), but not at follow-up (effect size: 0.15). Finally, the find- ing of positive adaptation effects appears to depend on the pres- ence of intentional motor deficits in neglect [61], suggesting that the therapy may only be useful for patients with a special variant of neglect.",

    "text": "A number of studies have explored the possibility of using tran- scranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to ameliorate neglect. The rationale is that neglect is partially due to an imbalance of inter- hemispheric inhibition [62], which can be corrected by applying inhibitory stimulation over the intact (left) hemisphere. Of par- ticular interest is a stimulation consisting of continuous trains of rapid bursts of pulses (TBS), which has been shown to decrease brain excitation for a prolonged period [63]. Nyffeler et al. [64] reported a decrease of neglect symptoms for 8 hours follow- ing two trains (each 44 s) of TBS applied over the left posterior parietal cortex. The duration of effects could be extended up to 32 h post-stimulation when four trains of TBS were applied. This finding supports the view that a decrease of cortical excitability directly affects the degree of inhibition of the damaged right by the intact left hemisphere. The principle was extended in two recent single-blind studies. Koch et al. [65] treated nine neglect patients during 2 weeks with continuous TBS over the posterior parietal cortex while a control group received sham stimulation. Results showed that the TBS group increased their scores in vari- ous neglect tests following therapy and at follow-up (2 weeks later) while the sham group showed no significant changes. In addition, the authors showed that TBS leads to a decrease of cortical excit- ability as evidenced by decreased potentiation of motor evoked potentials by a conditioning TMS pulse applied over the parietal",

[66] observed that repetitive optokinetic stimulation with random dots mov- ing at varying speed from right to left may significantly improve neglect symptoms. In a recent large randomized-controlled trial these authors compared the effects of five sessions of optokinetic\n\nstimulation (each 50 min) to visual exploration training [67]. They found strong effects of optokinetic stimulation on cancel- lation, reading, line bisection, but also on auditory midline judg- ment, while no changes were observed after exploration training (Figure 22.3). Kerkhoff et al. [68] further extended their findings by demonstrating that optokinetic stimulation is feasible at bed- side and that its effects extend to measures of functional inde- pendence. These results support the view that oculomotor deficits in neglect are central [69] and that stimulation of the oculomo- tor system may improve spatial attention and recalibrate the ego- centric reference frame. The finding that optokinetic stimulation improves a measure of auditory neglect is particularly interest- ing, as it suggests that a purely visual stimulation may have mul- timodal effects, and thus supports the view that neglect reflects impairment of modality-independent spatial representations [70, 71].",

Niemann et al. [74] compared the efficacy of a specialized attention training program to a control training centred on memory problems. Thirteen ran- domly allocated chronic head-injured patients practised com- puterized attention tasks in 18 sessions, which probed focused attention (identifying coloured targets) or set-shifting (moving attention away from one stimulus feature to another), both in the visual and the auditory modality. The authors found that patients participating in the attention training had significantly improved scores in several neuropsychological tests evaluating speed of processing, selective attention and sustained attention, while no generalization to tests evaluating memory was found. Indeed, attention training may have specific effects on the trained atten- tional dimension but may not generalize to other dimensions. Sturm et al. [75] selected specific training programs according to the most impaired domains of attention in a group of stroke patients. Training of attention tasks (e.g. alertness or vigilance) lead to relatively specific improvements in the trained function. Vigilance training improved measures of vigilance, but also reac- tion time in a task evaluating selective attention. The authors con- cluded that specific attention problems need very specific training.

Compared to non-treated controls the trained patients showed significantly better scores on tests of auditory and visual attention 5 weeks after the end of the training. However, no differ- ence between groups was observed for secondary measures, sug- gesting that the best effects were obtained in tasks that were similar to the trained tasks. Similar results were observed in a study in which head-injured patients were trained to divide attention in tasks whose difficulty progressively increased [77].

These capacities include the initiation of new actions, inhibition of inappropriate behaviour, maintenance of specific behaviour, planning and organization, and generative thinking [39, 83]. Patients with dysexecutive symp- toms may exhibit impairment in one or several functions, often in domains that appear contradictory. For example, a patient may have difficulty initiating an activity, but once started may fail to interrupt the activity when an alternative reaction is required. Another characteristic of these patients is that they may not ver- bally report their cognitive failures, which may become evident only when the patients attempt to execute an action. For example, a patient may adequately describe what is required from him in a given task, yet fail to follow his own action plan, a behaviour that has been termed \u2018goal neglect\u2019 [84]. Rehabilitation programmes mainly target disorganized behaviour through acquisition of new routines, training of problem-solving and metacognitive strate- gies. In addition, recent work has focused on the failures of some patients with executive dysfunctions to regulate emotion and to anticipate the outcomes of their behaviour, in particular in social situations.",

The acquisition of new habits (such as operating a new TV set) may require decomposition of a complex task into discrete com- ponents that can be followed step by step. Patients with persevera- tive behaviour or impulsivity may fail to implement and follow a simple action-plan. The aim of the intervention is therefore to brake down the task into logically structured steps, to develop a simple checklist allowing the patient to follow these steps, and to practise the routine repeatedly [39]. Unfortunately, this approach has not been evaluated in clinical studies. It is therefore unknown whether it leads to improved retention of new routines. However, there is good evidence that a much simpler method may improve temporal routines: Patients with executive dysfunctions often show difficulty respecting time schedules, even if these are repeti- tive [85]. These failures have been successfully treated with a pager system that permitted to send brief messages shortly before the appointment or the task that had been scheduled. The study included a group of patients who failed in prospective memory tasks due to memory problems or executive failures [41]. The fact that patients continued to complete scheduled tasks even after withdrawal of the pager suggests that simple prompting is a pow- erful way to acquire new routines.",

Levine et al.

However, such effects of a very short intervention are unlikely to be maintained in the long run. Thus, this study provides a proof-of-principle result but is no proof of clinical effectiveness [82]. A more recent study examined the effects of 14 hours of GMT immediately after the end of the therapy and at follow-up 4 months later [90]. The study involved patients who had suffered from traumatic brain injury at least 6 months before the study, all of whom had shown good recovery, were inde- pendent in everyday activities, but reported executive problems. The GMT group showed a decreased number of attentional lapses and better problem-solving performance after the therapy and at follow-up compared to a group receiving a control intervention (Figure 22.4).

Accordingly, some studies observed improved performance in executive tasks that had not been spe- cifically trained. On the other hand, programmes such as GMT are relatively complex and require a high degree of awareness of one\u2019s own deficits as well as a good capacity to monitor one\u2019s own actions. Such programmes may therefore be only applicable to patients with relatively slight impairments.\n\nsuccessful in reducing anger in patients with traumatic brain injury [97, 98], but showed mixed effects on depressive symptoms in post-acute stroke patients [99]. Future studies should evaluate whether etiology, chronicity and type of behavioural symptom (e.g. depression versus anger and irritability) are significant pre- dictors of positive effects of CBT or other interventions. Due to mixed findings, these approaches are considered practice options as there is currently no formal confirmation of their efficacy.",

    "text": "Neurobehavioural symptoms and impaired emotional regulation Along with cognitive impairment, deficits of emotional regula- tion are crucial predictors of social functioning and integration [94]. Neurobehavioural deficits include apathy and lack of drive, carelessness, and social isolation, as well as disinhibition, irritabil- ity, aggressiveness, or sexually inappropriate behaviour. Although some of these deficits are linked to specific cognitive impairments or to a difficulty in comprehending actions, intentions, and emo- tions of others (\u2018theory of mind\u2019) [95], they may occur in isolation or become evident during recovery following brain damage. These symptoms are generally perceived by the family and by the patient (if she/he has sufficient insight) as extremely disturbing and are important sources of caregiver stress. Interventions used to treat severe neurobehavioural symptoms apply principles of operant learning, such as reinforcement, interruption, and the analysis and modulation of contextual variables favouring dysfunctional behaviour. The effects of an intervention based on behavioural and contextual analysis were examined in a randomized trial including caregivers of patients with behavioural problems fol- lowing traumatic brain injury [96]. Patients and their caregivers received special education concerning the behavioural sequelae of traumatic brain injury as well as assistance with the definition and treatment of problematic behaviour. For example, an intervention strategy for the control of outbursts of anger included identifica- tion of anger-eliciting cues, relaxation training, and reinforce- ment of verbal expression versus acting out strong emotions. The results showed a reduction of disruptive and",

    "text": "Conclusion and perspectives Neurorehabilitation of higher cognitive functions is confronted with several problems that may complicate conclusions regarding the efficacy of specific interventions. One problem is the lack of evi- dence that training\u2014even if it generates better performance in a specific task\u2014transfers to daily activities. This is mainly due to the difficulty to evaluate trained functions in standardized ecological situations. Evidence for a transfer mainly comes from observational scales, which are sources of bias and do not necessarily measure all significant changes. Another problem is that most studies included small groups or single patients, making randomization difficult or impossible. Finally, behavioural interventions are often incompati- ble with blinding of the patient and the therapist since the objectives of the intervention are clear from the outset. For these reasons, the common quality criteria for therapeutic trials (e.g. placebo control, blinding of patients and therapists) are often not applicable to cog- nitive intervention studies.",

    "text": "Despite these drawbacks, data accumulated in the last 15 years show that neuropsychological rehabilitation may lead to significant improvement of the trained functions. The evidence is particularly strong for spatial neglect, where physiological stimulation techniques (such as optokinetic stimulation) and transcranial stimulation lead to long-lasting improvements. The training of attention generally shows specific improvements in the trained task, but little or no generaliza- tion to other tasks. In the domain of memory and executive function compensatory strategies and goal management can be recommended. Whatever the domain, intensive training is necessary to obtain sig- nificant and lasting effects on performance and independence.",

A separate section on nutrition and hydration in the Francis report [2] highlights its relevance to clinical practice and that failure of provision is a valid and very obvious sign of ineffective or negli- gent clinical practice. The National Patient Safety Agency and The Royal College of Nursing [3] have confirmed that hydration is a fundamental aspect of care and everyone in a healthcare environ- ment has a role to play in ensuring patients do not become dehy- drated. In the fourth Nutrition Screening Week survey (spring 2011) malnutrition (medium and high risk according to MUST (Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool)) was found to affect one in four adults on admission to hospital, more than one in three adults admitted to care homes in the previous 6 months, and up to one in five adults on admission to Mental Health Units in the United Kingdom [4]. Unfortunately, it is clear that admission to hospital may further compromise nutritional problems that have developed in the community, with obvious detrimental effects on the presenting medical or surgical problem. At a time of rapid sci- entific and technological development in all medical specialties, it seems improbable that we should not be succeeding in meeting such well-described and basic needs.",

Occasionally problems with eating and drinking, and an underlying neurological condi- tion (e.g. Arnold\u2013Chiari malformation), are recognized for the first time only after a presentation with aspiration pneumonia [5] .\n\nIf a problem with oral feeding is recognized there are usually four important issues that require careful consideration: the underlying diagnosis of the disease process, the mechanism of the problem, the most appropriate interventions, and the prognosis. The latter is usually closely linked to the prognosis of the underlying disease. It is common for diagnostic and management issues to require atten- tion concurrently, often involving a range of healthcare profession- als; a nasogastric tube may be required whilst investigations get underway to establish a diagnosis of both the underlying condi- tion and the exact mechanism of the feeding problem. The con- sequences of even short periods without adequate hydration and nutrition justify considering the different diagnostic and manage- ment issues in parallel rather than in series.",

Stroke illustrates this. The residual oral feeding problem in patients who have made some progress after lateral medullary syndrome has more in com- mon with a recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy than it has with other stroke syndromes, because airway closure during swallowing is a prerequisite for sustainable oral feeding. Similarly, a pure corti- cobulbar palsy causing profound slowing of tongue movements and impaired oral control of a bolus has comparable effects on oral feeding whether it is due to motor neurone disease, multi- ple sclerosis, or cerebrovascular disease. The mechanism of the swallowing problem, rather than the underlying disease process is also the most important determinant of the techniques used to enhance oral feeding.",

A nasogastric tube is relatively easy to insert and highly effective in delivering food and water and it is questionable whether remedial action, by resident nursing and medical staff, about such basic requirements can be postponed because of protocols requiring referral to more specialist ser- vices, especially when those services are not immediately avail- able. However, as problems of a very practical nature are being addressed, there are often difficult decisions to be made which require a working and detailed knowledge of the neuroanatomy of oral feeding as well as the more traditional insights required to diagnose the underlying disease process. Once in the midst of a complex case, the responsible team needs microscopic, telescopic, and periscopic perspectives, as well as an array of very practical skills, to ensure that patients get both adequate sustenance and an accurate diagnosis.",

There are upper airway reflexes which leave the larynx in a state of readiness as a result of stimulation of neighbouring structures, for example the glottopharyngeal reflex which, in response to stimulation of the pharynx produces partial adduction of the cords without producing laryngeal closure.

The consist- ency of food presented to the patients determines the nature of the challenge their swallowing and breathing has to overcome; steak and chips is a completely different kettle of fish to a pureed pud- ding with custard-thickened liquids. Thin liquids require careful control in the mouth and they easily breach laryngeal defences if there is untimely escape from the mouth. Food requiring chew- ing and significant tongue movement to prepare it to an appro- priate consistency will be inedible for patients with weakness or slowing of bulbar structures.

Therefore if there are no symptoms and signs in the limbs a high index of suspicion regarding structural disease is required. Sometimes, structural disease of the mouth, pharynx or oesoph- agus can be complicated by neurological disease, producing a diagnostic trap for the unwary. A carcinoma of the oesophagus complicated by polymyositis can produce a swallowing problem through both obstruction and weakness; a mediastinal mass in an older male can produce paraneoplastic myasthenia gravis as well as a recurrent laryngeal nerve palsy or compression of the oesoph- agus; hyperthyroidism can produce a myopathy and enlargement of the thyroid gland, both of which may affect laryngeal elevation during swallowing.",

Patients with a given neurological con- dition are vulnerable to routine problems such as concurrent infection, drug side effects and changes in mood and motivation, all of which can unhinge oral feeding without signs of the under- lying disease having progressed. Patients with neurodegenera- tive disease may become unusually susceptible to the side effects of medication (e.g. Lewy Body disease and major tranquillisers). In very vulnerable patients, particularly those with advanced degenerative diseases, a banal problem can completely disrupt the oral feeding routine. New onset atrial fibrillation in patients with Freidrich\u2019s ataxia, oesophageal reflux in percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG)-fed patients with multiple sclero- sis, and constipation in patients with severe head injury, are just a few examples of situations in which precarious but established oral feeding may fail.",

    "text": "Mechanism of oral feeding failure If these more traditional diagnostic questions have been success- fully answered, there is also great merit in trying to diagnose the mechanism of the oral feeding problem. In some conditions this is very straightforward. Using the description of normal feed- ing and the examples of how it may be disrupted by different diseases, it should be possible, if the disease process has been identified, to anticipate the mechanism of the oral feeding prob- lem, by methodically working through the four domains of clini- cal problems that may affect oral feeding: swallowing (including the preoral stage and chewing), respiratory function (including cough and control of respiration around deglutition), the addi- tional neurological, general medical and surgical problems, and the situation in which the patient is being cared for. Muscle dis- ease causes weakness, therefore the main impairments of laryn- geal elevation, lip control, and head and neck posture, and of breathing, are likely to be a result of weakness. Common compli- cations of the disease should also be anticipated, such as second- ary musculoskeletal changes. However, even when the disease has been diagnosed with confidence, the mechanism of the feed- ing problem may not be evident. In patients with motor neuron disease upper motor neuron involvement may affect oral con- trol and bolus preparation, but laryngeal function, particularly reflex closure of the larynx, may be relatively unaffected.

    "text": "In more acute situations a number of studies highlight the poor correlation between bedside tests of swallowing\u2014using trials of swallowing and detailed clinical examination\u2014and the results of investigations that allow one or more of the components of swallowing to be observed e.g. videofluoroscopy and fibreoptic endoscopic evaluation of swallowing [11]. This raises questions about the different approaches to assessment of oral feeding and the relative merits of tests that look only at swallowing. If oral feeding is considered rather than just swallowing, it immediately becomes apparent that, for example, the effectiveness of coughing and posture control may be as important as swallowing function in determining the success or safety of oral feeding. If the clinical assessment is confined to swallowing, the subsequent discussions are impoverished and are unlikely to lead to a comprehensive assessment of their feeding ability. The same applies to the use of ancillary investigations; the immediacy of videofluoroscopy images is arresting, but the presence or absence of aspiration in a few sequences in optimal conditions is unlikely to be repre- sentative of eating and drinking over a longer time period, and of course pulmonary function, cough, and control of respiration around deglutition are not part of a videofluoroscopy assessment. In this regard, the results of investigations that involve imaging or direct visualization of the structures involved in swallowing, or images tracking the course of the bolus, have to be interpreted with caution, particularly if there are observations garnered dur- ing a representative time period that suggest that oral feeding is, or is not, proceeding successfully.

In his original work Sherrington, in decerebrate cats, described whisky as the most effective phagetic agent, as it seemed to elicit reflex swallowing (laryngeal eleva- tion and closure) more reliably than water or liquids of an oily consistency [8] . Although the consistency of the food and liq- uid may be of relevance to the elicitation of reflex swallowing, the consistency of the bolus determines the challenge faced by the simple mechanics of ensuring the preparation and propul- sion of the bolus in to the oesophagus without any of it reach- ing or breaching the sphincter of the airway, the larynx. Fluids with the consistency and viscosity of water are a stringent test of laryngeal closure and oral control; simply by thickening liquids they can become manageable in the mouth and less of a threat to the airway.

NG, nasojejunal, PEG, radiologically inserted gastrostomy, percutaneous endoscopic jejunostomy, and surgically placed jejunostomy are the typical options, with NG and PEG the most frequently used devices. Over half of those patients established on home enteral feeding have conditions involving the nervous system, with stroke the most common diag- nosis. The use of fine-bore tubes has improved the tolerance of NG tubes and some patients in the community continue to use them. Their placement is not without complication, typically as a result of trauma and abrasions to the lining of the nose and naso- pharynx, and improbable outcomes of placement (e.g. intracranial placement through the cribriform plate), have been recorded. PEG placement is associated with more risks, including those of sed- ation (usually with midazolam), endoscopy and penetration of the peritoneal cavity and the wall of the stomach. The morbidity and mortality associated with PEG insertion suggests that it should be undertaken only in selected patients, ideally following a multi- disciplinary discussion.

Thus, DO is a kind of smooth muscle spasticity that was previously also termed detrusor hyperreflexia [5] . Again, the severity of DO depends on the extent of lesions. A patient with a complete spinal cord injury at thoracic level 10 will almost always develop a DO following spinal shock phase. In contrast, a small incomplete lesion at the frontal horn might not at all cause DO. Another severe dysfunction that can occur with suprasacral lesions is detrusor-sphincter-dyssynergia (DSD). In healthy con- ditions, detrusor contractions during voluntary micturition are usually accompanied by a synergistic sphincter relaxation to let the urine pass. This synergistic function of detrusor and external urethral sphincter is mainly coordinated by neurons in the dor- solateral pons [6]. In DSD, pontine input to the LUT is disrupted,",

The illustration summarizes the findings of neurophysiological animal studies from De Groat et al. [1] and early functional neuroimaging studies in humans from Blok et al. [2]. During the storage phase (a), which normally accounts for most of the daily time (98%), the detrusor is relaxed and the bladder neck closed due to a certain sympathetic tone on bladder body and bladder neck. Sympathetic fibres travel along the hypogastric nerve from the sympathetic nuclei in the intermediolateral column of the lumbar spinal cord to the LUT and provide adrenergic input to beta-receptors on intramural ganglia of the bladder body (\u2192 relaxation) and alpha-receptors at the bladder neck (\u2192 contraction/closure). Bladder afferents traverse through the pelvic nerve and enter the dorsal horn of the sacral spinal cord. At low filling volumes, there might be only little afferent activity and weak afferent signals might reach the PAG and diencephalic structures (e.g. thalamus), but bladder sensations do usually not reach consciousness during this state. With increasing bladder volumes, afferent activity might increase probably due to changes in intravesical pressure and at some degree of filling, bladder sensations will reach consciousness in form of a first desire to void. From the sacral dorsal horn, excitatory collaterals reach to the sympathetic nuclei in the lumbar intermediolateral column and to the sacral frontal horn, where the motor neurons of the external urethral sphincter (EUS) are located (Onuf\u2019s nucleus), to facilitate sympathetic input to the bladder and",

Another region supposed to be responsible for continence is the pontine L-region (named L-region as it is lateral to the other relevant pontine structure named pontine micturition centre or M-region or Barrington\u2019s nucleus), which has excitatory input to the EUS motor neurons in Onuf\u2019s nucleus and thus facilitates the elevation of the EUS tone. If the decision to empty the bladder is made (in the higher brain centres), the periaqueductal grey (PAG) activates the pontine micturition centre (PMC) (b). The switch between L-region and PMC activation is sometimes model-likely simplified as moving a lever from one programme to the other. Only one region can be activated at a time. From the PMC strong inhibitory inputs reach the sympathetic nuclei in the intermediolateral lumbar cord to suppress the sympathetic input to bladder body and bladder neck to enable a synergic micturition. Simultaneously, the PMC has strong excitatory projections to the parasympathetic nuclei in the sacral spinal cord that in turn activate the detrusor muscle via muscarinic receptors. The parasympathetic fibres travel along the pelvic nerve. In addition to the parasympathetic activation, the PMC has excitatory collaterals to inhibitory interneurons in the sacral cord that reduce the activity of EUS motor neurons, and thus facilitate EUS relaxation and synergic micturition. 1. de Groat WC.

The health related trou- ble with DSD are the extraordinary high intravesical pressures that occur during DO, as the spastic detrusor is now pressing against the outlet resistance of the spastic sphincter. Such elevated pressures will, in the long term, jeopardize lower and upper uri- nary tract function and morphology [7].\n\nAn especially hazardous complication that typically occurs with SCI above the splanchnic sympathetic outflow (T5\u2013T6) is autonomic dysreflexia (AD) [8] . AD, most frequently elicited by bladder and/or bowel distension, is a severe and potentially life-threatening condition, characterized by an excessive rise in systolic blood pressure accompanied by a decrease in heart rate. The pathomechanism of AD relies on the decoupling of descend- ing central (brain stem) inhibitory pathways to the sympathetic chain. This becomes especially eminent with SCI lesions above T6 due to the lack of central modulation on the splanchnic nerves that usually emanate below T5 but innervate the critical mass of blood vessels required to cause elevation of the blood pressure [8].

However, it appears that certain cerebel- lar and/or basal ganglia lesions are associated with DSD as such regions seem to exert relevant functional control on the periaque- ductal grey (PAG) and/or pons [9, 10].",

Transit of faeces in distal direction and storage of faeces until defecation is appropriate.\n\nNeurogenic control of the GI tract comprises an intrinsic (enteric) and extrinsic nervous system. The intrinsic nervous system is unique to the GI tract and can be divided into a myenteric and submucosal plexus, which are densely connected by interneurons. The myenteric plexus mainly controls the circular and longitudinal muscle layers while the submucosal plexus has secretomotor (small intestine) and sensory function and innervates the muscularis mucosa and submu- cosal vessles. Both plexus enable autonomic GI peristalsis and might in total contain up to 100 million neurons, which is similar to the amount of neurons in the human spinal cord [11].",

Such factors and processes include sensation of rectal filling, amount of stool in the rectum, adequate colonic and rectal motility (i.e. high-amplitude propa- gated contractions), and adequate relaxation of sphincters and pelvic floor. Although most of such processes are not voluntarily controllable, it is, under healthy conditions, possible to voluntarily decide where and when to defecate. Thus, anorectal activity seems to be at least partly under supraspinal control similar to the LUT. Indeed, recent neuroimaging studies of anorectal control revealed involvement of very similar supraspinal areas as described for LUT control [12].",

In contrast, subconal lesions (i.e. cauda equina lesions), typically result in rectal hypotonia and increased compliance, leading to slow stool propulsion. Subconal lesions are commonly associated with constipation and a significant risk of incontinence due to the atonic external anal sphincter and lack of control over the leva- tor ani muscle [14]. However, this classical view does not always match with clinical findings, which might be due to the fact that the exact level and extent of autonomic nervous system lesions is difficult to assess and that the exact post-injury interaction of the intrinsic and extrinsic nervous system is unknown.

Supraconal lesions may affect whole colonic transit, whereas subconal lesions predominantly cause transit delay in the left colon and rectosigmoid [17]. The latter is also frequently associated with other neurological diseases such as PD and MS, causing constipation and defecation difficulties [18, 19]. In PD, how- ever, pathophysiological processes in NBD seem to be very different to SCI or MS, as PD seems to directly affect also the intrinsic nerv- ous system of the GI tract. This is supported by the reduced number of dopaminergic cells found in the colonic wall of PD patients [20] and Lewy body formation in the enteric ganglia [21].",

Supraspinal pro- cesses even allow humans to experience sexual arousal and excite- ment from spontaneous memory. In consequence, the brain can be regarded as the primary human sex organ [24]. Although\n\nrecent neuroimaging studies have provided valuable additional insight into supraspinal activity during different phases of human sexual response [25], the exact processes and neurophysiologi- cal mechanism are not yet fully known or understood. Findings from studies in animals and humans (predominantly lesion stud- ies) propose a network of supraspinal key areas that are involved in sexual arousal and behaviour (Table 24.4) [26, 27]. This net- work influences spinal sexual reflexes and is itself modulated by sensory feedback (e.g. visual, tactile, olfactory, auditory), and by neuroendocrine effects of sex hormones. Dopamine, oxytocin, gonadotropin-releasing hormone, melanocyte-stimulating hor- mone, and norepinephrine (noradrenaline) act as excitatory neurotransmitters, whereas opioids, endocannabinoids, and ser- otonin act as inhibitory neurotransmitters within this network [28]. Lesion of one or more key areas can result in significant aber- rant sexual function and behaviour [26].",

Since an erect penis is the main prerequisite to perform \u2018conventional\u2019 sexual intercourse, erectile function is often used as pars pro toto for male sexual function. In general, two types of erection can be distinguished: psychogenic and reflexogenic erection. Both forms of erections interact syn- ergistically, improving the response of each other to achieve an erection that is adequate for penetration and sexual intercourse [29, 30].",

Such erotic stimuli can trigger responses in the brain that cause the release of neu- rotransmitters such as dopamine and oxytocin, which facilitate hypothalamic emission of pro-erectile signals to the sacral erectile centre (S2\u2013S4). Parasympathetic outflow from the sacral erectile centre via the cavernous nerve to the arterial sinuses of the cor- pora cavernosa causes smooth muscle relaxation mainly by release of nitric oxide of the parasympathetic nerve terminals [29]. This causes arterial dilatation and increased arterial inflow with con- sequent expansion of the corpora cavernosa. Simultaneously, the expanding corpora cavernosa compress the intracavernosal and subtunical venous plexus, prohibiting outward flow of blood and thus allowing penile expansion to full erection [29].",

Ejaculation requires emission of semen into the posterior urethra, which is sympathetically controlled and induced by peristaltic contractions of the smooth muscles of the vas deferens, seminal vesicles, and prostate [29]. In addition, sympathetic output provides closure of the bladder neck, which is required to prevent retrograde ejaculation. Intermittent relaxa- tion of the external urethral sphincter allows semen to enter the bulbous urethra from where semen is propelled outside through the urethral lumen (= ejaculation) by rhythmic contractions of the ischiocavernous and bulbocavernosus muscle, which are induced by a sacral reflex mediated by the pudendal nerve [29]. However, full erection is not always necessary for ejaculation and orgasm, and ejaculation is not necessarily accompanied by orgasm.",

Engorgement of blood in the vaginal wall raises the pressure inside the capillaries and creates an increase in transudation of plasma through the vagi- nal epithelium [31]. In addition, the vagina lengthens and dilates during sexual arousal as a result of vaginal wall smooth muscle relaxation. Such processes are probably mediated via parasym- pathetic output of nitric oxide and vasoactive peptide. However, the exact mechanism remains to be elucidated and involvement of other neurotransmitter is matter of current investigations [31]. Towards orgasm, vaginal luminal pressure progressively increase and finally climax in a series of clonic contractions of striated and smooth muscles [31].",

Strokes in certain brain areas can affect sexual desire; strokes affecting frontolimbic connections, and areas such as frontal lobe or thalamus, can result in disinhibited sexual behaviour, whereas strokes of basal ganglia and parietal areas seems to diminish sex- ual drive [33]. Ejaculatory dysfunction has also been reported [33]. However, stroke rarely cause sexual disorders alone and is mostly a consequence of factors associated with stroke such as psycho- logical disorders, such as depression, and concomitant medication (i.e. antihypertensive medications such as beta-blockers) [34, 35]. In addition, most stroke patients have concomitant risk factors for sexual dysfunction such as diabetes and vascular disease. Other factors contributing to a decreased sexuality post stroke are sen- sorymotor and cognitive impairments with potentially \u2018unattrac- tive\u2019 behaviours such as urinary incontinence and drooling, and psychological factors such as fear of relapse and anxiety by the patient and partner [34, 36].",

To protect upper urinary tract function and prevent long-term complications, it is necessary to maintain or restore the LUT as a low-pressure urinary reservoir and to provide unrestricted, low-pressure urinary drainage from the kidneys to this urinary reservoir and from the reservoir outwards.",

Inhibition or reduction of detrusor overactivity is mainly achieved by the following conservative or surgical measures:\n\nConservative treatment Antimuscarinics The first-line conservative measure to reduce NDO are antimus- carinic drugs [63] that can be applied either orally (oxybutynin, trospium chloride, tolterodine, solifenacin, darifenacin, propiver- ine, fesoterodine), transdermally (oxybutynin), or intravesically (oxybutynin, propiverine). Detrusor contractions are mainly elic- ited by parasympathetic input to the detrusor via acethylcholine release from parasympathetic nerve terminals, i.e. pelvic nerve, and subsequent activation of muscarinic M2 and M3 receptors on the detrusor [64]. Antimuscarinics cause a competitive blockage of the M2 and M3 receptors resulting in a reduction of parasym- pathetic influence on the detrusor and consequently a reduction in detrusor contractility [65].",

For dorsal genital nerve stimulation (DGNS), several techniques have been described, including usage of transcutaneous needle electrodes. Usually bipolar stimulation is applied using two self-attaching surface electrodes on the dorsal side of the penis or using two ring electrodes. In females, surface electrodes are usually attached to the labia majora and to the con- tralateral pubic skin. For percutaneous tibial nerve stimulation (PTNS), a 34-gauge needle electrode is inserted approximately 5 cm cephalad to the medial malleolus and posterior to the tibia (Figure 24.7) with a surface electrode on the arch of the foot [75]. Both methods provided promising initial results in the treatment of NDO and also demonstrate improvements of other urodynamic parameters [78\u201382]. However, there are few long-term results and larger randomized controlled trials, which might be, in addition to the handling and necessity for regular appliance of an external device, a reason that this kind of therapy is still not very com- monly used, despite that commercially devices are available and adverse events are almost nonexistent.",

Thereby, BoNT/A causes a chemodenervation of the detrusor which is presumably not 100% but sufficient enough to cause a significant reduction in detrusor tone and pressure. However, this therapy is not self-applicable and patients have to return for reinjec- tion, as the average duration of efficacy is 8 months [90] due to resprouting of the axon terminals [88, 89]. Despite their limited duration, BoNT/A intradetrusor injections are highly effective with only few and usually self-limited adverse events, includ- ing urinary retention, hematuria, injection site pain, procedure related urinary tract infection, and generalized muscle weakness [90]. Urinary retention has to be always considered and explained to the patient. Usually it is necessary that the patient learns how to perform CISC before the injections [91]. In SCI patients uri- nary retention might not be relevant in most cases, as patients are often already on CISC. Hematuria (2\u201321%) is usually very mild and self-limited, however, clotting parameters and concomitant medication (e.g. plavix, coumarin) should be checked to avoid a hemorrhagic vasical tamponade.

    "text": "Sacral neuromodulation (SNM) SNM is a minimally invasive procedure that includes in a first step the placement of electrodes (tined lead, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) next to the sacral nerve roots, usually S3, by needle puncture of the S3 foramen under fluoroscopic control. During the procedure, repetitive test stimulations can be per- formed to find the optimal position for definitive electrode place- ment. Following the placement of the electrode, the electrode lead is passed subcutaneously and connected to an external tempo- rary stimulator. Electrodes might be placed uni- or bilateral. The procedure can be performed in local or, if necessary, in general anaesthesia. Local anaesthesia has the advantage that the sur- geon can obtain sensory feedback from the patient while placing the electrode. Using the external temporary stimulator, efficacy of SNM on LUT symptoms is evaluated using bladder diaries or even urodynamics on an outpatient basis. If SNM attributes to at least 50% improvement, a permanent neuromodulator (Interstim\u00ae or InterStim-II\u00ae, Medtronic, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) is implanted in a second step. The permanent stimulator is usually placed subcutaneously in the buttock. If the SNM test phase does not demonstrate successful symptom reduction, electrodes can be easily removed. During the test phase, adverse events appear to be extremely rare, whereas during the permanent SNM phase after neuromodulator implantation, adverse events such as lead migration (7%), pain at neuromodulator implantation site (5%), infection at neuromodulator implantation site (5%), hypersensi- tivity to stimulation (4%), infection at lead site (2%), pain at lead site (1%), lead fracture (1%), migration of",

    "text": "Achievement of continence Continence can be improved or achieved using the therapies mentioned for treatment of NDO, behavioural therapy, but also by applying therapies that improve sphincter function in cases of sphincter and bladder neck insufficiency. Insufficiency of the clos- ing mechanisms at bladder neck or sphincter due to the lack or impairment of neurogenic innervation of these structures results in neurogenic stress urinary incontinence (nSUI).\n\nSurgical therapy of nSUI aim to support or increase the clos- ing function of sphincter or bladder neck. Three different types of surgical interventions can be distinguished: (1) injectables (e.g. bulking agents), (2) suspensions (e.g. Burch, suburethral tapes and slings), and (3) implants (e.g. artificial sphincter). To apply these therapies, it is absolutely mandatory that the patient has a normo- or hypotone detrusor and no or sufficiently treated NDO. Otherwise these therapies would be counterproductive to thera- peutic principle (1).",

Such therapy does not actually treat the underlying cause of urinary incontinence but rather contribute to avoid urinary incontinence and helps to regain control of urinary continence. Timed voiding (= fixed time interval between micturitions that might be even indicated by alarm) might be useful in patients with impaired bladder sensation to prevent overflow incontinence or potentially in patients with mild terminal DO to prevent DO incontinence. In general, such behavioural regimens have to be adapted to the individual abilities and needs of the patient and suit best for patients in whom urinary incontinence is mainly due to cognitive or motor deficits. However, in such cases, caregivers need to provide additional support.",

    "text": "The currently most widely used artificial sphincter model (AMS 800\u00ae, American Medical Systems, Minnetonka, Minnesota, USA) consists of 3 major components, the inflatable cuff, the pump, and the pressure-regulating balloon (Figure 24.9). All three compo- nents are implanted and connected via special flexible but non- colliding tubes, allowing hydraulic functioning of the sphincter. The inflatable cuff is placed around the bulbar urethra (in men) or bladder neck (in men after prostatectomy and women or in some neurogenic indications) and connected to a control pump that is placed in the scrotum (in men) or labium majus (in women). The balloon is placed in the subperitoneal space lateral of the blad- der. Activating the pump deflates the cuff by pumping the water from the cuff into the balloon, from where it flows back into the cuff due to the hydraulic gradient between balloon and cuff. The re-closing of the cuff takes 2\u20134 minutes during which the patients can empty the bladder via spontaneous voiding or CISC. The arti- ficial sphincter is suitable for both men and women. Due to its high efficacy, the artificial sphincter is today\u2019s gold standard in the therapy of SUI [140]. Also patients with neurogenic SUI, in whom the natural sphincter is insufficiently working due to damage of its neuronal control, have greatly benefited from this therapy [149]. The success rate (proportion of continent patients) in patients with neurogenic SUI lies between 23% and 91% (mean 73%) [150\u2013156]. However, Fulford et al. and Venn et al. investigated a mixed popu- lation (neurogenic and non-neurogenic SUI) [150, 156].",

This system also seems to have some advantage in regard to the risk of pump-erosion in wheelchair bound female patients [157]. In addition, cuff pressure can be adjusted at any later time point via the subcutaneous port. The inflatable paraurethral balloons are a rather new technique [158, 159] and only one study reports results in NLUTD [160]. The balloons are placed bilaterally of the urethra at the bladder neck (in women) or at the membranous urethra (in men) and can be inflated until the desired effect is achieved or the maximum capacity of the balloons is reached. Each balloon has a port that is placed into the ipsilateral scrotum or labium majus. The infla- tion is performed during follow-up visits with saline via the port of each balloon. Depending on the volume, the balloons cause a functional obstruction that should keep the urine within the blad- der during situations of increased abdominal pressure.",

The puborectalis muscle is separated from the rec- tum providing direct access to the superior aspect of the pelvic floor muscles. A series of sutures are placed in the two limbs of the pelvic floor including the puborectalis, forming a lattice across the pelvis [176]. The original technique was described by Parks in 1975 [177] and aimed at restoration of an acute anorectal angle, improv- ing continence by creating a flap valve effect of the puborectalis sling. However, other considerations suggest that the procedure attains its effect rather by increasing the functional length of the anal canal than by changing the anorectal angle [178]. Prospective evaluation of the technique in patients with neurogenic faecal incontinence demon- strated excellent short-term efficacy with favourable safety [179].",

Patients with neurogenic lesions or diseases should know that sexual dysfunction can occur as a symptom of their neurological condition and that there are therapeutic options available that can help to alleviate or even abolish sexual dysfunc- tion. However, approaching patients in the early phase of their neurogenic lesion or disease can be delicate and even appear inap- propriate as patients might struggle with other, \u2018more important\u2019 matters of their neurological disease and disability. Nevertheless, counselling on sexual dysfunction should not be deferred to the very end of a rehabilitation or treatment course but rather be step- wise integrated for example into the counselling on other pelvic organ dysfunction such as bladder and bowel, giving the patient the time to become comfortable discussing also sex related health issues. Timely counselling on sexual dysfunction can help to pre- vent the development of misapprehension, prejudice, anxiety, and frustration in patients dealing with sexual dysfunction.

All PDE-5 inhibitors promote smooth muscle relaxation within the arterial sinuses of the corpora caver- nosa and consequently penile erection by prolonging the effect of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) in the smooth muscles. cGMP is the active component that causes smooth muscle relaxa- tion and is converted from guanosine triphosphate by the enzyme guanylat cyclase under the influence of nitric oxide released from the parasympathetic nerve terminals of the cavernous nerve [217]. cGMP is usually hydrolyzed and inactivated to GMP by the PDE-5. All PDE-5 inhibitors have similar efficacy and tolerability but differ regarding onset and duration of action. Sildenafil and vardenafil are effective after 30\u201360 minutes and last for 4 hours, whereas tadalafil is effective after 30 minutes and lasts for up to 36 hours [218]. Treatment should be started with 50 mg/day using sildenafil or 10 mg/day using vardenafil or tadalafil. Dosing can be increased up to 100 mg/day using sildenafil and up to 20 mg/day",

To maintain this erected state after removing the pump, a constriction ring made of elastic rub- ber is placed around the base of the penis, preventing premature outflow of blood from the penis. It is important to select the cor- rect size of the constriction ring as the whole procedure might be inefficient if the ring is too large or, if the ring is too tight, damage to the penis might occur. It is generally recommended that the constriction ring should not be used for more than 30 minutes. The vacuum pump plus constriction ring is effective in about 60\u201370% but requires some dexterity by the patient or partner [222]. It should not be used in bleeding conditions.

However, current data are limited.\n\nImplantation of a penile prosthesis can be considered as last resort when all other therapeutic approaches have failed or are contraindicated. Despite the high satisfaction rates for patients and partners (70\u201390%), it is an invasive procedure with irrevers- ible damage to the corpora spongiosa as those are replaced by the prosthetic rods [218]. In general, two types of prosthesis can be differentiated, malleable, and inflatable. Malleable prostheses usually consist of a pair of flexible silicon rods that have sufficient rigidity for penetration. With this form of prosthesis, the penis is always in the \u2018erected mode\u2019 and intercourse could be immediately started just by bending the rods into the appropriate position. Inflatable prosthesis require three components: inflatable cylinder that provides erection sufficient for penetration when inflated, a reservoir, and a pump. The reservoir might exist as a separate part or might be integrated into the cylinder. Complications include pain, device infection (2\u20134%), mechanical device failure, and device perforation/arrosion [218].",

The underlying hypothesis was that sacral neuromodulation might be able to positively influence the neural plasticity of LUT relevant nerves below the lesion and thus can contribute in the reduction of DO [243]. The results were extraordinary, as all patients were con- tinent, the DO abolished, and UTIs significantly reduced during a mean follow-up of 26 months [243]. In addition, bilateral SNM facilitated bowel and erectile function in some patients. Lead dis- placement and/or rupture in 5 of 10 patients caused recurrence of DO, which could be treated with replacement of the electrode [243].

A current investigation evalu- ated a new method to improve electrode placement [246].\n\nA different approach has been described by Possover et al., with laparoscopic bilateral implantation of octapolar electrodes directly across the pudendal and sciatic nerves in complete SCI patients with DO [247]. Pudendal stimulation with 15\u201320 Hz caused an inhibition of DO up to 550 ml during filling cystom- etry [247]. Subsequently, the pudendal stimulation was switched off to unleash a detrusor reflex contraction. In patients with no or insignificant DSD this resulted in efficient bladder emptying [247]. However, DSD could get in the way of that outcome. Thus, Possover et al. tried not to switch off pudendal stimulation com- pletely, but rather switch to high frequency pudendal stimulation with 1200 Hz, resulting in a reduction of DSD and nearly com- plete bladder emptying [247]. However, it has to be admitted that Possover et al. still used Fintech\u2013Brindley electrodes in addition to the octapolar pudendal electrode to promote sufficient bladder emptying [247].",

    "text": "Other relevant targets for future pharmacological therapy of NDO that have been recently described are cannabinoid-2-receptors and fatty acid amide hydrolases in the LUT and spinal cord [251, 252], Also properties of already available drugs are currently revis- ited that might lead to new applications in the treatment of NLUTD [253].\n\nNerve re-routing Re-routing of LUT nerves after SCI has been investigated in ani- mals and recently also in a quite large population of complete SCI patients. This technique is based on a microsurgical anastomo- sis between the L5 and S2/3 ventral root, leaving the dorsal roots intact (Figure 24.12) [254, 255]. The idea is that impulses delivered from the efferent neurons of a somatic re\ufb02ex arc can be transferred to initiate responses of an autonomic effector [254, 255]. To elicit a bladder contraction, patients have to scratch or squeeze on the L5 dermatome [254, 255].",

However, the therapy success was poorly defined. Post void residual significantly decreased from 332 ml to 31 ml and maximum urinary flow increased from 2.4 to 14.3 ml/s, but maximum detrusor pressure decreased, although significantly, only from 82 cmH2O to 62 cmH2O and bladder capacity remained nearly unchanged (364 ml preoperatively vs. 387 ml postoperatively) [254, 255]. Moreover, patients had to wait for approximately 1 year until improvements occur [254, 255]. Although this approach seems to be an interesting alternative with only few reported adverse events, it appears inferior in effi- cacy to previously described techniques like botulinum toxin intradetrusor injections, augmentation cystoplasty and SARS + posterior rhizotomy. Other groups currently do not confirm the initial results of Xiao et al. [256].",

Persistent pains of various origins are common and serious consequences of spinal cord injury (SCI) and stroke [3, 6] with large numbers of patients reporting pain despite the availability of a variety of phar- macological and non-pharmacological treatments [7\u201312]. A few medications have shown to significantly reduce neuropathic pain severity in SCI clinical pain trials [13\u201318]; however, no treatments are currently available that completely relieve neuropathic pain [19\u201321]. Persistent pain is associated with lower well-being, higher levels of depression catastrophizing, affective distress [2, 22\u201327], significant psychosocial impact [28\u201331], and lower quality of life [22, 32\u201334].",

    "text": "Most persistent pains can be categorized into two principal types: nociceptive and neuropathic. Nociceptive pain is caused by the activation of nociceptors or pain receptors, and may be associated with inflammatory mechanisms [3] . This pain type is defined by the International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP) as: \u2018Pain that arises from actual or threatened damage to non-neural tissue and is due to the activation of nociceptors\u2019 (IASP Task Force on Taxonomy [35]). The IASP also added the critical statement that nociceptive pain is used to describe pain occurring within a normally functioning somatosensory nervous system. After SCI, it is generally accepted that pain above the neurological level injury (NLI) is nociceptive as it occurs in an area that has normal somatosensory function as measured with the American Spinal Injury Impairment scale [36]. However, nociceptive pain that is present in an area with significant sensory dysfunction (e.g. pain located either around or below the NLI), is more difficult to determine based on these criteria. Therefore, the determination of nociceptive pain below the NLI should include additional crite- ria such as changes in pain depending on movement or change in position, muscular tenderness, evidence of skeletal pathology that is consistent with the pain distribution, dull or aching pain quali- ties, or reduction in pain due to anti-inflammatory medication [4]. A common example of nociceptive pain in persons with SCI is musculoskeletal neck and shoulder pain due to overuse.",

    "text": "Neuropathic pain caused by an injury to the brain can present anywhere in the body such as in a hemiplegic shoulder after a stroke [37]. In contrast, neuropathic pain after SCI is primarily present at or below the level of injury. However, the recent SCI pain classification also includes other types of pain not directly caused by SCI to facilitate clinical utility ([4] , see Figure 25.1). At-level neuropathic pain is either central in nature (e.g. central neuropathic pain; CNP) or peripheral and caused by injury to the spinal nerve roots. As a contrast, below-level neuropathic pain is a CNP type and a direct consequence of the SCI. CNP can also be a significant part of the complex clinical picture associated with different types of trauma and diseases involving the CNS, such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, tumours, syringomyelia, brain or spinal cord injury, or Parkinson\u2019s disease [38, 39]. CNP is often associated both with evoked non-painful and painful sensa- tions such as hyperalgesia (exaggerated pain in response to a mild painful stimulus) and mechanical or thermal allodynia (pain in response to a non-painful stimulus such as light touch, pressure, cool or warm stimuli) [39, 40]. These sensory abnormalities should be routinely assessed as part of the pain evaluation. Although CNP is prevalent after SCI [3], the frequency of CNP in the gen- eral population is relatively low [38], and therefore standardized diagnostic and outcome measures are of critical importance since these can facilitate both multicentre trials and the interpretation and application of research results to improve clinical treatment.",

However, many underlying mechanisms such as central sensitization are commonly involved in a variety of pain conditions and are not specific to pain type [41]. Nociceptive pain types have similar mechanisms in neurotrauma populations as in the general population; these may include peripheral sen- sitization, decreased inhibition, increased facilitation, etc. [42].",

    "text": "Injury to the CNS causes widespread changes in both sensory neurons and in various central pain pathways and brain structures and these changes have the potential to result in persistent neuro- pathic pain [44\u201348]. One hypothesis that has been proposed is that clinical pain phenotypes (specific combinations of pain symptoms and sensory signs) may reflect underlying mechanisms [48, 49]. Unfortunately, mechanisms of neuropathic pain after neurotrauma are complex with multiple combinations of contributing mecha- nisms, including loss of inhibition and increased hyperexcitability [50\u201356], making these translations more difficult. Preclinical research suggests that the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain after SCI is associated with multiple molecular and plastic changes in the central nervous system. These changes include: up-regulation of chemokines and chemokine receptors in the spinal cord [57]; changes in neurotrophic factors and in TrkB tyrosine kinase signalling path- ways in the spinal cord [58]; brain plasticity caused by cannabinoid and vanilloid receptors, and chemokine interaction [59]; changes in calcium ion channel expression [60] and membrane transporter pro- teins [61]; loss of inhibitory interneurons in the spinal dorsal horn [62]; inflammatory mediators [63]; and activation of glial cells in the spinal cord and brain [64].",

There are also important interrelationships between these assess- ment domains. For example, pain symptoms and signs that are common in neuropathic pain conditions such as intense pain, presence of hyperalgesia or allodynia, electric pain quality, and constant pain, have been associated with greater psychosocial impact [24, 65, 66], perceived as particularly disturbing [67] and predictive of using prescription medication after SCI [68].",

Approximately 75% of people with SCI and chronic pain can differentiate between different types of pain [67, 69]. Therefore, a comprehensive pain evaluation should carefully eval- uate each pain separately as part of the general pain assessment (Figure 25.1). For example, the International Spinal Cord Injury Basic Pain Dataset (ISCIBPD) [70] is designed to evaluate the worst, second worst, and third worst pain when a person experi- ences one or more pains. The ISCIBPD includes a pain classification made by a healthcare professional, and self-reported information regarding number of pain problems, pain location, intensity, and temporal pattern of pain (i.e. onset, presence, and number of days with pain over the last 7 days, duration, and variation in intensity) for each specific pain problem. In addition, the impact of pain on physical, social and emotional function, and sleep is evaluated. The ISCIBPD was reviewed and officially endorsed by major SCI and pain organizations (e.g. the International Spinal Cord Injury Society, the American Spinal Injury Association, the American Pain Society, and the International Association for the Study of Pain, and is now part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Common Data Elements http://www.commondataelements. ninds.nih.gov/SCI.aspx#tab=Data_Standards.

The ISCIP [4] provide a practical frame- work for classifying pain after SCI and its inter-rater reliability was established [72]. Similar pain taxonomies have also been pro- posed for other CNS conditions, such as Parkinson\u2019s disease [73]. Several self-report measures are available for assessment of gen- eral pain intensity or pain severity. The most commonly used is the numerical rating scale (NRS), which has been used widely to assess pain and has excellent reliability and validity [74]. An NRS usually consists of an 11-point scale for pain intensity, with the anchors labeled as 0 = no pain and 10 = most pain imaginable. Another example is the Pain Severity Subscale of the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) [75] which consist of three items concern- ing pain severity \u2018at the moment\u2019, during \u2018the past week\u2019, and suf- fering due to pain.

The DFNS [85] used a standard- ized protocol for the assessment and analysis of QST data from 1236 patients with the clinical diagnosis of neuropathic pain. Common clinical phenotypes based on QST were found in sev- eral neurological syndromes; however, there were important dif- ferences with respect to how frequently they were observed. The most common clinical pain phenotype in 27.5% of persons with central neuropathic pain included mixed thermal/mechanical sensory loss without hyperalgesia. This was also the most com- mon sensory profile identified in persons with polyneuropathy (26.2%), but less common in postherpetic neuralgia (13.9%), in peripheral nerve injuries (11.7%), in complex regional pain syn- dromes (3.5%), and in trigeminal neuralgia (7.6%). While most studies have concluded that injury of the STT is necessary for the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain it is less clear if damage to the DCML pathway is also required [86\u201394].The data from the DFNS suggests that a combination of STT damage and injury to the DCML pathways is an important mechanism rep- resented by a specific clinical pain phenotype with mixed ther- mal/mechanical sensory loss.

These authors suggested that neuropathic pain after SCI was associated with spontaneous activity in residual thermosensitive STT neu- rons triggered by inflammatory processes within the injured STT. Another important question is to what extent QST can be used to predict the development of neuropathic pain. One study [95] indicated that increased sensitivity to pinprick within the first year of SCI predicted the development of neuropathic pain. Another study [96] assessed 30 persons with SCI and 27 norma- tive controls for a period of 6 months after injury, or until central neuropathic pain developed. These results indicate that the best predictor of neuropathic pain development is dynamic mechani- cal allodynia below the level of injury and that neuronal hyper- excitability may precede the development of neuropathic pain. These findings are consistent with a recent prospective study in persons with SCI where early sensory hypersensitivity (assessed with SCI) predicted the development of below-level central neu- ropathic pain [97]. These results are also in agreement with basic research studies suggesting neuropathic pain may be caused by hyperactivity in residual STT neurons, partly due to complex molecular processes including up-regulation of intracellular sig- nalling proteins that influence the phosphorylation of kinases, transcription factors, and/or changes in membrane excitability of receptors [98, 99].",

Wydenkeller and colleagues [102] found that although CHEPs did not differ between persons with and without below level neu- ropathic pain, they were decreased in 94% of those with neuro- pathic pain. There was a slowing of EEG peak frequency in the 6\u201312-Hz range, in those with neuropathic pain, consistent with deafferentation. Interestingly, a discriminant analysis correctly classified 84% of subjects as having neuropathic pain versus not having neuropathic pain, based on their EEG peak frequency. In a recent study, Kumru and collegues [106], investigated the pain relieving effect of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) combined with visual illusion (VI) in 18 persons with SCI (14 able-bodied people served as controls). Compared to baseline, two weeks of tDCS + VI, resulted in 13 persons reporting a mean decrease of 50% in neuropathic pain intensity. Similarly, evoked pain intensity, and CHEPs amplitudes (evoked by stimuli applied at C4 dermatome) were significantly reduced, whereas QST heat pain thresholds increased after treatment (i.e. less sensitivity to heat). These studies suggest that CHEPs could potentially be use- ful both for diagnosis and support the potential utility of these methods as biomarkers of treatment outcome for people with SCI and neuropathic pain.",

Several methods are available for evoking cerebral responses that can be recorded (for a critical review regarding the advantages and limitations of the different methods, see [100]). The recorded responses\u2014evoked potentials\u2014are captured by electroencephalograph (EEG) elec- trodes placed in several locations on the scalp. Once recorded, the signals can be analysed with respect to specific characteristics (e.g. amplitude and latency), and interpretations regarding the func- tionality of a specific sensory modality can be made. Decrease in amplitude of specific EEG components, prolonged latencies, or absence of responses can occur in neuropathic pain conditions [101, 102].",

Therefore, personal adaptation and coping skills are crucial for optimal quality of life in these populations [110]. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials group (IMMPACT; www.immpact.org) suggested that in addition to assessing the severity of pain, other important health related quality of life domains (e.g. physical and emotional functioning) should be included in a comprehensive evaluation of pain reflect- ing its multidimensionality.

The Dysfunctional subgroup (including persons with higher levels of pain severity, life interference, affective distress and lower levels of life control and activities) and the Adaptive Coper subgroup (including persons with lower levels of pain severity, life interference, and affective distress and greater levels of life control and activities) have been identified in several different chronic pain populations [115] After SCI, however, a new subgroup, the Interpersonally Supported, with high levels of perceived positive support from significant others and lower degree of pain interference and affective distress, despite moderately high pain severity was reported [65]. People belong- ing to this latter subgroup appeared to have the impact of their pain moderated by social support. Greater perceived social sup- port often facilitate healthy behaviours such as adherence to treat- ment and adaptive coping.

For example, catastrophizing thoughts and negative pain beliefs were related to both greater pain interference and poorer mental health [121]. Consistent with these results, another study found that lower pain intensity was associated with greater levels of internal health locus of control and adaptive coping, and lower levels of catastrophizing thoughts [33]. Greater internal health locus of control orientation is important for greater productivity, satisfaction with performance of daily activities and community integration after CNS injuries [122]. Importantly, the sense of having control in one\u2019s life can be enhanced by incorporating education regarding pain as part of multidisciplinary pain management programs [123].

Spinal cord and deep brain stimulation (DBS) has pro- duced some pain relief both after SCI and stroke [154\u2013156]. Two studies involving persons with post-stroke central neuropathic pain, one involving 15 [151] and the other 31 patients [156], applied DBS in the thalamus and/or the periaqueductal grey. DBS resulted in 48.8% improvement in pain scores but there was a wide vari- ability in responses with about 70% responders for both studies.",

For example, the lat- ter randomized, sham controlled, double-blind, parallel group design study tested transcranial direct current stimulation and visual illusion in 39 patients with CNP. The best long-term effect (12 weeks after treatment) on pain intensity was obtained when the two interventions were combined. These studies suggest that both invasive and non-invasive treatments stimulating the brain and or spinal cord can be effective in reducing pain after CNS injuries and diseases.",

    "text": "The activation of somatic afferents via different modes (e.g. elec- trical, mechanical, or physiological) may be promising avenues as part of multidisciplinary treatment programs for both nocicep- tive and neuropathic pain. Massage and other physiotherapeutic interventions (e.g. application of heat, cold, transcutaneous elec- trical nerve stimulation (TENS)), are among the most common non-pharmacological methods used to relieve pain. In two sur- vey studies physiotherapeutic interventions were perceived as providing \u2018considerable to complete\u2019 pain relief in 50% of an SCI sample [8] , with pain relief often lasting hours to days [9]. Several studies suggest that acupuncture, TENS and massage, or combi- nations of these interventions may also be beneficial for neuro- pathic pain after CNS injuries [160\u2013164]. Findings of a 10-week exercise study suggested beneficial effects on both musculo- skeletal and neuropathic pain types associated with SCI [166]. Importantly, reductions in pain regardless of aetiology may have a profound effect on quality of life. For example, reduction in shoulder pain, after a 12-week, home exercise programme aimed to strengthen shoulder muscles and modify movements related to upper extremity weight bearing, resulted in significant increases in social participation and improvements in quality of life [34]. Similarly, another study including 80 individuals with paraplegia and musculoskeletal pain showed improvements in both pain and quality of life in response to a shoulder exercise programme [167]. An important part of a comprehensive approach to therapy- resistant pain is to increase individual coping skills with the goal of optimizing quality of life. Therefore, treatment strategies that include",

A recent multicentre trial [169] included 61 individuals with neuropathic pain and SCI. The participants were randomized to cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) or to wait-list control and the primary outcomes were pain intensity and pain-related disability and secondary outcomes were mood, participation in activities and life satisfaction. While CBT signifi- cantly reduced anxiety and participation in activities compared to control, there were no significant differences in pain intensity and pain-related disability. Another study in 22 people with MS exam- ined the effects of self-hypnosis training and progressive relaxa- tion [170]. Most of the participants reported that they found that both of these interventions caused pain relief. A more recent study also involving people with MS [69] suggested that a combination of self-hypnosis and cognitive restructuring may be more effective in reducing pain than either of the approaches alone. The results of these studies suggest that self-hypnosis and cognitive restruc- turing would be beneficial components of chronic pain manage- ment in a population with CNS injuries.",

    "text": "CHAPTER 25 the assessment and treatment of pain syndromes\n\nConclusion Severe, chronic pain of various origins is a serious consequence that affects many people after CNS injury or disease and one that can significantly interfere with daily activities and reduce quality of life. People who have sustained a spinal cord or brain injury or have a disease involving the CNS may also develop CNP. Unfortunately, currently available treatments for CNP are usually not effective, although anticonvulsants and antidepressants are often recom- mended as the first line of medication. The complex clinical pres- entation of pain in these populations with multiple simultaneous persistent pains of different origins and variable psychosocial impact suggest a critical need for individually tailored mechanism-based treatment approaches that also include psychosocial interventions. Although treating the underlying and contributing mechanisms of pain in each individual is the most desirable strategy, it is usually not possible because of our insufficient ability to determine the pri- mary underlying pain mechanisms in each individual. In order to move towards more mechanistically targeted treatment strategies, multiple aspects of the clinical pain condition (e.g. pain symptoms, sensory signs) needs to be systematically evaluated. Clinical evalua- tion should also include pain-related psychosocial variables associ- ated with persistent pain so that these can be addressed in the pain management design.",

Consequently, it is not itself pathological but is experienced to an extreme and disabling degree in many neurological conditions. In chronic fatigue syn- drome (CFS) extreme fatigue is the central feature of condition, and the physiological changes and behaviours associated with it probably contribute to the pervasiveness of symptoms and chro- nicity of the problem. These physiological changes and behaviours probably also contribute to fatigue in other conditions. These often represent potentially remediable factors, and consequently are important to identify and address. An individualized for- mulation is crucial to achieving this, a principle that will guide the structure of this chapter. First, we will consider how factors innate to neurological conditions and those secondary to them can contribute to fatigue. Then, we will discuss how understand- ing of these factors can be synthesized in the formulation to guide treatment. This chapter will focus on the commonest neurologi- cal conditions in which fatigue is prominent; multiple sclerosis (MS), stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), and traumatic brain injury (TBI). The same principles are applicable to fatigue in other neu- rological conditions.",

Non-pathological fatigue would be the experience of being tired after exercise, with energy restored after rest [1] . Definitions of pathological fatigue vary, but that of the MS Council is a good example, namely: \u2018a subjective lack of physi- cal and/or mental energy that is perceived by the individual or caregiver to interfere with usual and desired activities\u2019 [2]. The subjectivity of fatigue is emphasized in this definition, which is consistent with description of (post-stroke) fatigue as \u2018weariness unrelated to previous exertion levels and usually not ameliorated by rest\u2019 [3]. Other definitions, such as Staub and Bogousslavsky\u2019s, emphasize the subjective need for greater effort, which does seem to be a core feature of the fatigue experience in all contexts [4].",

    "text": "Although attempts have been made to separate physical and mental fatigue, this is often neither feasible nor useful. Others favour dividing fatigue in to \u2018central\u2019 and \u2018peripheral\u2019 compo- nents. Chaudhuri and Behan for example, define central fatigue as\n\n\u2018the failure to initiate and/or sustain attentional tasks and physi- cal activities requiring self-motivation (as opposed to external stimulation)\u2019, whereas peripheral fatigue is regarded as primarily physical or muscular in nature [5] . Central fatigue would be exem- plified by the perception that more effort is required to undertake a task than is normal in the absence of any overt physical disability (i.e. a sensory symptom), whilst peripheral fatigue might be char- acterized by the objective documentation that voluntary power declines during a task or on repetition of that task (i.e. a motor sign) [6]. Notwithstanding that neurophysiological testing is cru- cial in distinguishing the level of involvement of the motor system, in practice the usefulness even of this more considered distinction can be questionable [7]. Perceived levels of central and peripheral fatigue covary, and even in myasthenia gravis, that exemplar of \u2018peripheral fatigue\u2019, reports of mental fatigue are common [8].",

    "text": "Fatigue is dissociable from sleepiness, although there is over- lapping symptomatology [9] . Sleepiness is a physiological phe- nomenon, depending on previous sleep and occurring at regular intervals following a circadian rhythm [10] By contrast, fatigue describes persistent physical or mental exhaustion, not necessar- ily accompanied by sleepiness, and which sleep cannot alleviate. A patient may have both, and they are associated with common factors, for example the release of proinflammatory cytokines [11]. Apathy, even harder to distinguish from fatigue, is a feeling of indifference; fatigued patients generally retain an interest in their hobbies and interests, they just do not have the energy to undertake them. How to measure a subjective concept Peripheral fatigue, as an acute tendency for force generating capacity to diminish during sustained effort, can be fairly easily described and quantified. It is attributed to mechanisms such as the failure of neuro-muscular transmission, metabolic distur- bances, defects of muscle membranes, or peripheral circulatory failure [5] . Central fatigue is subjective, warranting intervention when a patient endorses the symptom, its importance, and desire for treatment. Many attempts have been made to quantify it. Mead et al. identified over 50 scales used to assess fatigue post stroke [12], some of the more commonly encountered being summarized in Table 26.1. Others have taken a different approach to assessing fatigue. For example, in stroke a semi-structured interview has been used, and \u2018caseness\u2019 defined as fatigue present most days for >50% of waking hours which interferes with everyday activities [13]. This approach has also been used to define CFS. It is clear,",

Fatigue imposes signifi- cant socioeconomic consequences, including loss of work hours and may be the most important factor in loss of employment [26, 27].\n\nAetiology and associations A combination of biological, psychological, and social factors con- tribute to fatigue in all patients. Though the relative contribution of each varies between diagnosis and patient, failure to consider each sphere can lead to suboptimal treatment in all. Obvious examples are failure to consider depression in an individual who has prominent fatigue following a stroke, or overlooking medica- tion side effects in a patient with CFS. Psychosocial issues, includ- ing unhelpful health beliefs, are particularly important to identify in neurological disease, as these may be the most modifiable maintaining factors. Though divisions are fluid, in this section potential contributions to fatigue will be separated into \u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018secondary\u2019 factors. The former are directly attributable to the neurological disease process, while the latter are physiologi- cal, psychological, or behavioural changes occurring as direct or indirect consequences. CFS is an example of a condition in which extreme fatigue exists in the absence of overt neurologi- cal pathology, but the presence of immunological and endocrine abnormalities is well established. This demonstrates both the arbi- trary separation between \u2018primary\u2019 and \u2018secondary\u2019 factors and the potentially profound impact that the latter can have. Effective treatment for CFS suggests what may improve fatigue in other conditions.",

In a 2009 cross-sectional study post-stroke fatigue was more common in stroke than tran- sient ischaemic attack (TIA) patients, suggesting at least some post stroke fatigue might be attributable to brain damage [31]. Systematic review found no association between fatigue and white matter lesions or brain atrophy, however, although some stud- ies did report an association with infratentorial or basal ganglia stroke [32]. No TBI studies examine correlations between struc- tural abnormalities with fatigue, but clinical markers of injury severity do not predict fatigue [33]. A study in patients who had had penetrating TBI found that fatigue was associated with ven- tromedal prefrontal cortex damage [34]. Reduced grey matter volume is reported in CFS [35], with increased prefrontal cortex volume following treatment with cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) [36]. In summary, when structural abnormalities are iden- tified they implicate involvement of frontal and subcortical brain regions in fatigue.",

    "text": "Sleep disorders In neurological disorders fatigue has a consistent relationship with broken sleep. Correlations with daytime sleepiness however, though present in TBI and PD, are surprisingly weak in MS [69\u2013 71]. Nonetheless, patients reporting daytime sleepiness should be screened for potential sleep disorders, including obstructive sleep apnoea, narcolepsy and restless leg syndrome/periodic limb movement disorder. The latter is particularly common in MS [72], while sleep-disordered breathing is a particular issue after stroke [73], and various sleep disorders are core features of PD [74]. Initial insomnia in the absence of obvious medical cause suggests anxi- ety, while early morning waking with inability to get back to sleep is more characteristic of depression. Other disease-associated problems such as pain, spasticity and nocturnal micturition also impact on sleep and require specific interventions. Pain Pain is common and can be difficult to treat. Robust correlations between pain and fatigue are reported in various neurological conditions [75, 76]. It is speculated that pain may contribute to fatigue through a reduction in central motor drive [77]. If associ- ated with activity it will encourage activity avoidance. Poor nutrition As 50\u201380% of in-hospital stroke patients have one or more eat- ing difficulties related to neurologic deficits, it is unsurprising that 50% of stroke inpatients are malnourished [78] Westergren reported that 6 months post-stroke poorer nutritional status was closely related to a lack of energy [79]. Effects are likely bidirec- tional, giving rise to a vicious circle.",

Though other factors likely contribute too, some evidence for the presence of deconditioning is provided by the proven efficacy of graded exercise programmes in reducing symptoms of CFS [82]. Neurological conditions are associated with substantial reductions in activity, and deconditioning has been reported in MS, stroke, TBI, and in PD [83\u201386].\n\nBeliefs about activity/cognitive style Cognitive factors believed to contribute to the maintenance of CFS include a tendency to focus on fatigue and perceive it as a negative experience (which consequently amplifies its perception) and beliefs of having a very limited ability to be active (leading to very low levels of activity) [87]. In CFS a strong belief in a physical cause of the illness, a strong focus on bodily sensations, and a poor sense of control over symptoms contribute to fatigue severity and functional impairment [88]. The importance of fear of symptom exacerbation in CFS was elegantly demonstrated in a cycling task. It was a more important determinant of distance travelled than physical symptoms, physical disability, mood, and other illness perceptions [89].",

Beliefs about the dan- gers of activity may be expected in MS, given that elevated body temperature or prolonged exertion exacerbates symptoms [57]. Though unstudied, it is likely that after a catastrophic event such as stroke fears of provoking a further stroke inhibit engagement with exercise in some patients. It has been reported in MS that a sense of control (often referred to as self-efficacy), reduces feel- ings of fatigue, whereas focusing on bodily sensations aggravates it [90]. MS patients who catastrophize about experiencing symp- toms (expecting the worst possible outcome), who are embarrassed about symptoms, or who believe symptoms are always a sign of physical damage are more likely to be fatigued [91]. A systematic review incorporating studies in cancer, CFS, MS, fibromyalgia, and healthy individuals confirmed a significant association between catastrophizing and fatigue [92]. Other cognitive styles also influ- ence fatigue and activity levels. For example, a qualitative study examining what determined whether people resumed previously valued activities after stroke identified \u2018all-or-nothing\u2019 thinking as a barrier [93]. \u2018All-or-nothing behaviour\u2019, that is, overdoing things when feeling better then needing to rest for prolonged periods to recover, is associated with fatigue in MS [91].

A baseline of activity and rest and a regular sleep pattern are established, and then gradual increases in both physical and mental activity col- laboratively planned. Patients are also helped to address social and emotional problems through problem solving.\n\nMultiple sclerosis An RCT of 72 fatigued MS patients reported that though fatigue decreased with both interventions, reductions were greater with CBT than relaxation therapy (effect size 3.0 vs. 1.8) [136]. CBT combined explanation of the cognitive behavioural model of fatigue, activity scheduling, sleep hygiene, and changing unhelp- ful cognitions about fatigue. Changing perceptions of fatigue (e.g. perceiving it as more controllable, as time limited and as having less serious consequences) mediated decreases in fatigue [137]. An Internet-based version of this intervention with telephone sup- port also resulted in significant reductions in fatigue [138], as did mindfulness training (compared to usual care) in an RCT of 150 patients [139]. Mindfulness aims to reduce stress through teaching a nonjudgmental awareness of moment-to-moment experience.",

    "text": "Stroke As discussed Zedlitz et al. reported that, though CBT alone had beneficial effects, reductions in post-stroke fatigue were greater when cognitive therapy was augmented with graded activity training [129]. The cognitive component was delivered in small groups and emphasised pacing, improved planning of activities and relaxation, with rather less focus on challenging unhelpful cognitions than CBT in the CFS and MS trials. These results need replication, but do emphasize the importance of exercise/graded activity accompanying any cognitive intervention for post-stroke fatigue. A small uncontrolled pilot study has since suggested mindfulness-informed CBT was associated with a reduction in post-stroke fatigue [140].",

It is generally coordinated by a specialist doctor, delivered by a team of different therapists, and not protocolized, being tailored to individual needs and goals.\n\nSeveral uncontrolled studies suggested multidisciplinary reha- bilitation is beneficial in CFS [142]. Though impact on fatigue was not a specific focus in Khan et al.\u2019s Cochrane review of the efficacy of multidisciplinary rehabilitation in MS, the review does sum- marize outcomes on this measure [141]. On the basis of two posi- tive RCTs of outpatient rehabilitation they report there is limited evidence that high intensity programmes can provide short-term benefit in fatigue, and insufficient evidence that a lower intensity programme can reduce fatigue. A home based intervention had no impact on fatigue compared to standard care, and the only study comparing inpatient rehabilitation to standard care was negative. Though benefits of multidisciplinary rehabilitation have been reported in other neurological conditions, specific effects on fatigue have not been examined.",

This may reflect however that it is the delivery of evidence based interventions directed at specific areas of need that is important rather than simply access to a variety of professionals [143].\n\nMedication Drugs such as antidepressants have proven benefit in treating secondary conditions common in neurological disease which contribute to fatigue.

Three RCTs examined the effect of Modafinil 200\u2013400 mg on MS fatigue. The smallest showed a significant reduction in fatigue compared to placebo, apparent within three hours [145]; the others reported only a trend towards greater fatigue reduc- tion (p = 0.07) [146] or no change [147]. Modafinil is generally well tolerated, but serious, life-threatening skin reactions, psychiatric adverse reactions (such as suicidal thoughts, depression, psychotic episodes) and cardiovascular adverse reactions (e.g. hypertension) have been reported [117]. A small non-placebo controlled study in stroke patients showed modafinil decreased fatigue severity in patients with brainstem and thalamic strokes (as well as MS patients), but not cortical infarctions [148]. Two small RCTs exam- ined the impact of modafinil on PD fatigue. Though both did not report significant change on any of the fatigue severity scales used, one did report improvement in clinical global impression of fatigue [149]; no safety concerns were raised. A single-centre cross-over RCT in patients with (predominantly moderate or severe) TBI found that it improved daytime sleepiness, but not fatigue [150]. Though numerous studies fail to demonstrate greater effects on fatigue than (generally pronounced) placebo effects, modafinil is generally the first-line (unlicensed) pharmacological treatment for fatigue in neurological disease.",

Exercise has the best evidence and should be encouraged in all patients. Ideally, indi- vidually tailored programmes would be provided, such as the Exercise After Stroke programme delivered in some UK leisure centres. If not available, but mobility is reasonable, regular walks starting from a modest base are a good option. If there seem to be barriers/reservations about exercise, clinicians must explore what these are and correct any misunderstandings about the perceived dangers of activity/exercise. CBT has reasonable evidence, but",

Rehabilitation is generally viewed as future-directed and goal-oriented, aiming to increase func- tion and social participation. Palliative care, on the other hand, is seen to deal in loss\u2014of independence, of social roles, and, ulti- mately, of a future. There is, however, strong alignment between the objectives of rehabilitation, and those of palliative care. According to Wade and de Jong [1] , rehabilitation is a process of assessment and goal-setting, with interventions directed towards maximizing well-being and participation in order to achieve adaptation to disability and to minimize carer stress. The World Health Organization [2] defines palliative care as an approach that improves quality of life of patients and their families through assessment and treatment of physical, psychosocial and spiritual problems. Dame Cicely Saunders, a pioneer of the hospice move- ment in the United Kingdom, describes it thus: [palliative care will] \u2018not only help you to die peacefully, but also to live until you die\u2019 [3: p. xxiii].",

Palliative rehabil- itation enables people to be as active and independent as possible within the constraints of a deteriorating illness, taking a realis- tic approach to patient goals. It supports adaptation to disability and coming to terms with changed circumstances, striving to respond rapidly to changes in abilities, goals, and needs. It uses the expertise of a multidisciplinary team with effective coordi- nation of care to ensure consistency in approach. It is accepting of uncertainty and loss, anticipating deterioration and allowing time for relevant issues to be addressed with patients and those close to them [4] .",

Crucially, this is as much about a patient\u2019s psy- chological resources as it is about their physical capacity.\n\nTaking account of what patients say is important to them towards the end of life, it is evident that that palliative rehabilita- tion has a great deal to offer. A number of research studies [5\u20138] show that patients want their symptoms to be well managed, their care to be well coordinated, and to avoid the inappropriate prolongation of dying. They wish to be able to maintain a sense of control, achievement, and self-worth, and to relieve the bur- den upon others. Strengthening relationships with loved ones is particularly important, as is the opportunity to say goodbye and bring closure. Rehabilitation makes an important contribution in all of these domains. According to the National Council for Palliative Care [9] , palliative rehabilitation provides strategies and support to help people to adapt to illness and disability, and to be able to acknowledge approaching death. It enables people to perceive some control in their lives, and to maintain a sense of self as worthwhile and competent. It opens up possibilities for pleasur- able activities and provides the means to be engaged in these.",

Disease trajectories in neurological conditions are less predictable with a longer time-course. They are characterized by periods of relapse and remission rather than steady decline. Patients may have mul- tiple disabilities with cognitive, behavioural and communication problems in addition to physical deficits [11, 12]. A further, impor- tant consideration is that people with long-term neurological con- ditions, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or Parkinson\u2019s disease, are likely to have extensive experience of managing life with a dis- ability [13]. This expertise must be recognized and respected, and incorporated into all aspects of care and rehabilitation [14, 15].",

For example, preventative, supportive, and palliative rehabilitation could be used to help a person with late-stage MS to manage fatigue: education on pacing and gentle exercise, sup- portive strategies to set and achieve reasonable, desirable goals, underpinned by the recognition that the patient\u2019s priorities will be shaped by their understanding of their prognosis.",

The domains that should be assessed are set out in Table 27.2.\n\nAssessment can be carried out through low key observation and conversational approaches, or via structured, standardized assess- ment tools, or a mixture of both. Many palliative rehabilitation cli- nicians favour a low-key approach, which has the advantage that patients are not put through rigorous, formal functional assess- ments that further deplete limited energy supplies, and may quickly be out of date as the disease progresses [21]. There is also a notion that standardized assessments with checklists are a barrier to devel- oping relationships with patients, and that they are not sufficiently individualized and patient-focused. While relationship-building and patient-centredness are important in the assessment pro- cess, there is evidence to suggest that patients\u2019 concerns are more reliably through systematic, structured assessment. Homsi and colleagues [22] studied 200 patients consecutively referred to a pal- liative medicine programme, and compared open-ended questions with a 48-item symptom checklist. The median number of symp- toms found using systematic assessment was ten-fold higher than those volunteered through open questioning.",

Similarly, it is helpful to include carers and fam- ily members in assessments where appropriate and possible\u2014for example, a shower assessment together with the carer who will be helping the patient with the activity.

Rehabilitation is often one component of a range of interventions provided by a multiprofessional team and it can be difficult to separate out the specific contribution of the rehabili- tation element; many rehabilitation outcome measures anticipate that functional gains will be made, which is often not the case in palliative care where patients are deteriorating.

    "text": "Taylor [27] contends that adjustment to illness centres around three themes: a search for meaning in the experience, an attempt to regain mastery over the event in particular and over life in general, and an effort to enhance self-esteem. Patients might plan to travel abroad, or have ideas about manufacturing their own aids and adaptations, or resuming previously enjoyed hobbies, or they might look forward to being able to walk again. Research with people with metastatic spinal cord compression has shown that while patients take steps towards achieving these things, they also avoid situations in which their abilities could be directly challenged [30]. In this regard, patients\u2019 orientation to disability incorporates two appar- ently inconsistent attitudes (see Figure 27.2). On one hand, there is an acknowledgement that something significant has changed and that, as a consequence, functional boundaries and limitations will need to be explored, new self-management skills learned, and use- ful information sought. On the other hand, patients avoid acknowl- edging problems, determined to hold on to a sense of themselves as competent, resourceful human beings. These two orientations are in conflict, and patients look for ways to manage this tension by revising their expectations (changing the goalposts), indefinitely deferring anticipated pleasures, and by avoiding situations in which their abilities might be put to the test. Patients \u2018twin-track\u2019\u2014run- ning their acknowledgement of changed circumstances alongside a view of themselves as capable. This overly-optimistic view of self and of future events does not necessarily prevent them from mak- ing sensible, practical plans for the present, and it can help to sup- port",

Teaching patients how to adapt movement patterns and postures can be helpful, such as sitting rather than standing to do a task. Energy conservation techniques equip patients and their carers with the skills to choose and balance desired activities or exercise with periods of recovery and rest. These strategies might be counterintuitive for patients whose past experience of healthy tiredness has taught them that rest is an effective remedy. Carers too can feel that they are being kind and supportive by encour- aging the patient to be less active, without realising the adverse effects of deconditioning.

From diagnosis people can experience a sense of aban- donment and isolation, which can continue for months or years [41]. Wollin [42] notes that feelings of disbelief and devastation are experienced not only by patients but also by their families, emphasizing the need for support for family relationships and not just individuals. These feelings of loss persist throughout the disease course. In MS, patients who have severe disability iden- tify two significant areas of loss: the loss of personal independ- ence and the loss of employment, which in turn lead to a loss of self-esteem, social contact, and income [43]. These multiple losses make adaptation and adjustment challenging, and cognitive behavioural therapy can be helpful in this regard. These feelings of loss, concern about death, and the need to adjust are traditionally the domain of palliative care but, where patients are well known to neurological services, the involvement of the neurological team may lead to better continuity of care.",

What is apparent from this literature, however, and has relevance for rehabilitation at the end of life, is that disability and burden on others are both cited by patients as reasons for considering assisted suicide [47\u201349].\n\nIn a controversial report, the Commission on Assisted Dying [50] set out a case for allowing assisted dying in terminally ill adults. There are strong views on both sides of the debate, but the one aspect of the report that received unanimous support was the statement that comprehensive palliative care should be available to everyone living with life-threatening illness, at all times, and across all care settings. While one wants to avoid the na\u00efve and simplistic view that given the proper care and facilities no-one would choose to die, it is vitally important to make sure that peo- ple reaching the end of life are able to live in a way that preserves their dignity and self worth.",

Disabled people giving evidence to the Commission expressed the concern that \u2018less politicized disabled people, or peo- ple who first develop an impairment later in life as a result of ill- ness . . . might be more prone to adopt negative social perceptions about the status of disabled people in society\u2019, and that a sense of oneself as worthless and burdensome could influence judgements and decisions about whether life was worth living [50: p.291]. As we noted at the beginning of this chapter, rehabilitation in pallia- tive care is concerned with enabling people to participate to as full an extent as possible in all aspects of their daily lives\u2014making the most not only of their physical capacity, but also their psycho- logical resources. Rehabilitation has an important part to play in supporting a person\u2019s perception of him or herself as a worthwhile individual with something to contribute to society, even in the late stages of illness.",

In addition to the basic good commu- nication skills required in any healthcare context, there are two issues that have particular relevance in palliative care: being com- fortable talking about death and dying, and being able to manage uncertainty.\n\nTalking about dying The National Service Framework for Long Term Conditions [51] emphasizes the importance of clinicians having the skills to address patients\u2019 fears and concerns about death. Patients are likely to have thoughts (and possibly fears) about the manner and timing of death, even if these are not voiced. For this reason, death and loss need to be on the agenda from the start, even when death is not imminent. People need to be given both the opportunity and the permission to ask questions, and clinicians need to find ways of making it clear to patients that they are comfortable hav- ing such conversations. Simply asking patients whether they have any fears or concerns about the future can be a way of doing this.",

Interpersonal factors relate both to interactions with patients and with colleagues. It is possible to become too invested in patients\u2019 problems without giving enough attention to personal replenish- ment [53]. Some patients can remind us powerfully of people we have known personally, making it hard to avoid over-identifying with their situation. Receiving inadequate emotional and practi- cal support from colleagues can compound this. From a health systems perspective, the pressures inherent in the organizations in which we work can be stressful. Inadequate resources, poor coor- dination of care and bureaucracy can make it impossible to deliver what we would want for our patients, leading to feelings of frustra- tion and powerlessness. The moral and ethical dilemmas that arise in palliative care can lead to professional dilemmas, particularly when patients\u2019 wishes conflict with codes of ethical conduct. For example, respecting a patient\u2019s autonomy and valuing the practice of goal setting can be difficult when that patient\u2019s stated goal is to end their life.",

The opportunity to make a difference in people\u2019s lives at a very challenging time can engender a sense of being involved in something meaningful and important.

Being instrumental in patients achieving their goals can provide families with good memories in difficult times. Contributing to patients being able to die where they chose, having put their affairs in order, enjoy- ing warm relationships with those close to them can show us that death can be peaceful and well managed.

However, we do want to make sure that stress is well managed, and\n\nCHAPTER 27 neuropalliative rehabilitation 349\n\nthat we are controlling it, rather than the other way around. There are a number of things that we can do to manage and reduce stress [54]. These involve attending to both personal and environmental factors, gaining a clear understanding of ourselves and our work environment.\n\nAt a personal level, we need to understand our own resources, motivations, values, and limitations. We can use both behav- ioural and cognitive strategies to implement change where needed\u2014doing things differently, as well as changing habits of thought and attitudes. Developing a level of self-awareness is important, particularly in understanding our personal phi- losophy of illness, suffering and death. Working with a mentor or clinical supervisor to do this can be beneficial. In terms of environmental factors, we need a realistic appraisal of exter- nal resources, identifying where they are plentiful and where they are limited. Having a clear understanding of what is expected of us, and what is reasonable and achievable within the resources available is extremely important. The New Economics Foundation [55] offers a set of simple, practical, evidence-based actions to promote well-being in everyday life. These are shown in Table 27.5.",

These patients are often referred to as having \u2018functional overlay\u2019. Functional overlay is relatively common: in a recent study [1] of over 3,000 consecutive outpatients presenting for the first time to neurological services, 12% of those with neurological disease or structural damage were also reported by their treating neu- rologist to have \u2018symptoms unexplained by disease\u2019. There was no significant difference between different neurological diagnoses and the likelihood of patients having functional overlay, though some smaller studies have focused on particular causes of neuro- logical disease and have reported some differences in the likeli- hood of functional overlay occurring in different disorders (e.g. a higher rate of somatoform disorders has been reported in those with Parkinson\u2019s disease as opposed to atypical parkinsonism and dementia [2, 3]).",

Operational criteria for clinical identification include: (1). One or more of the following: confusion or disorien- tation, loss of consciousness for 30 minutes or less, post-traumatic amnesia for less than 24 hours, and/or other transient neurologi- cal abnormalities such as focal signs, seizure, and intracranial lesion not requiring surgery; AND (2).

This task is rather difficult as few studies have explored in detail the diagnosis, pathophysiology and treatment of functional symptoms specifically in the setting of CNS damage. A major exception to this is the quite extensive study of patients who have an inexplicably catastrophic outcome after what appeared to be minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI), a phenomenon sometimes called post-concussional syndrome. We have therefore focused this chapter on this topic, while also drawing on evidence for the diagnosis, pathophysiology, and treatment of functional symp- toms in a more general neurological setting.",

Following this line, a recent study has underlined once again the role of alcohol in head injury and has examined the subsequent risk of epilepsy.

In support of this contention, there is no clear positive correlation between the severity of TBI and PCS development; on the contrary, moderate to severe injuries do not tend to cause PCS. This piece of evidence brings into question the use of the word \u2018concussion\u2019 to describe this syndrome: surely concussion would be expected to be most severe in those with moderate to severe TBI? Added to this is the finding that typical symptoms of \u2018PCS\u2019 are also seen in patients who have suffered (often minor) limb injuries where there is good evidence of there being no injury to the head. Such symptoms are also commonly seen in patients with chronic pain disorder, or even in healthy controls. These observa- tions are part of the background against which there has been an ongoing debate as to whether \u2018PCS\u2019 is best considered a \u2018neuro- genic\u2019 or a \u2018psychogenic\u2019 disorder, and also if for some patients it is a genuine entity at all or simply reflects deliberate generation of symptoms for financial gain.",

Between 1866 and 1882 Erichsen described in his publications what was defined as \u2018railway brain\u2019 or \u2018railway spine\u2019 as \u2018certain obscure injuries of the nervous system commonly met with as the results of shocks of the body received in collisions on railways\u2019 and he suggested that minor head and spine injuries might cause severe disabilities due to \u2018molecular disarrangement\u2019 in the nervous system. A number of contemporaneous medical authorities such as Wardsworth, Page, Strumpel, and Oppenheim debated the nature of this syndrome trying to clarify whether it was a \u2018functional\u2019 disorder (Page in 1883 used this term for the first time), an \u2018organic\u2019 brain damage or whether it reflected exag- geration of symptoms as a compensation law was approved in Europe at that time for personal injury.",

The two main components of this shift in approach have been (1) an emphasis on making a diagnosis based on positive aspects of the history and physical signs rather considering the diagnosis of functional neurological symptoms as a diagnosis of exclusion, and (2) an acceptance that psychologi- cal factors, particularly childhood emotional trauma, may not be important for all patients who develop such symptoms, and cer- tainly that the presence or absence of psychopathology should not unduly influence the diagnosis.",

This especially applies to com- plaints of poor memory, which on neuropsychological testing is revealed to be related to poor attention and concentration.\n\nThere is a growing appreciation of the role of physical precipi- tating factors in the mechanism of functional neurological symp- toms. Physical precipitants commonly include injury (typically limb injury), but also intercurrent illness, operations, drug reac- tions, etc. Such physical precipitants are reported in up to 80% of those with functional neurological symptoms. This clearly does not deny a role for psychological/emotional triggers, and indeed it is impossible to separate out the physical and psychological aspects of response to such physical triggers [14, 15]. This is in accordance with recent models of other functional somatic syn- dromes such as chronic fatigue syndrome and irritable bowel syn- drome [16], which are typically preceded by a flu-like illness or an episode of infective diarrhoea, respectively. The common occur- rence of physical precipitating factors triggering onset of func- tional neurological symptoms defined on positive clinical criteria clearly provides a plausible mechanistic link for the triggering of functional symptoms after mTBI.",

In particular, currently available evidence does not support neuronal damage as the main underlying mechanism [5].",

It is important to note, however, that many patients with poor outcome after mTBI are receiving medication (often analgesics) and these too can have a direct effect on cognitive performance, as can coexistent mood problems. The most common complaint is that of memory and attention difficulties [22]. Recent studies have demonstrated that symptomatic patients with PCS after mTBI show cognitive seque- lae such as reduced verbal fluency and working memory func- tioning compared to healthy controls and asymptomatic patients. However, the idea that mTBI can have sustained consequences, and that the subjectively experienced symptoms and difficulties in everyday situations might be related to objectively measurable parameters in neurocognitive function, is still matter of debate",

In addition, it is man- datory to perform tests of effort, which help to evaluate whether a patient\u2019s poor score on cognitive testing is likely to represent a false positive due to poor effort. Such tests cannot, however, dis- tinguish between poor effort due to malingering and poor effort related to the underlying neurobiological mechanism behind functional neurological symptoms or factors such as low mood.",

These criteria attempt to separate out causation (conversion disorder vs. facticious dis- order vs. malingering) from the common symptoms that patients present with. They emphasize the need for effort testing, and the positive diagnostic use of identification of particular patterns of memory/cognitive disturbance (loss of remote autobiographical memory, inability to perform simple overlearned skills such as reading, writing, or simple maths) that are not commonly seen in those with even moderate brain injury. They also emphasize the positive diagnostic utility of incongruity between performance on cognitive tests and behaviour observed in a more natural setting. Reports of speech and language deficits persisting one year after mTBI have described patterns of \u2018non credible speech and lan- guage deficit\u2019 including \u2018foreign accent syndrome\u2019, atypical dys- arthria, stuttering, severe expressive aphasia, and speech apraxia. Foreign accent syndrome is a rare condition, which can follow a damage of right hemisphere, typically a cerebrovascular accident. It is characterized by changes in rhythm, prosody/intonation and phoneme production of speech in absence of other cognitive defi- cit such as aphasia. Recently, few cases of functional foreign accent syndrome have been reported after mTBI, in absence of structural CNS lesion [30, 31]. Cases of functional stuttering [32] have been reported after mTBI. Such cases were usually of sudden onset after mTBI in the absence of structural brain damage, and where the pattern of stuttering was inconsistent with the typical",

The motivation for the use of many of these technologies is simple to understand, since these devices serve to augment therapies deliv- ered by the clinicians, increasing their reach, and they may also prove to be more cost effective as well, in some clinical settings.",

It was shown earlier in a number of studies on animal models, for example, that locomotor training in which an animal is suspended above a treadmill so that the treadmill is allowed to promote \u2018pas- sive\u2019 walking by moving the animal\u2019s legs, that even animals with complete spinal cord injury will often generate natural locomotor patterns within a relatively short period of time.",

This is because the robot sensors can register the amount of weight bearing that the patient can sustain, the tolerated gait speed, and the patterns of muscular activation, all measures of overall impairment levels.",

In most published trials the responses of robotic training for either upper or lower extremity have been marginally better than those provided by an experi- enced therapist (e.g. Lo et al.

Although this task was manageable initially when subjects were weak, in many cases the limbs developed progressively increasing spasticity, providing progressively larger and larger resistances to externally imposed motion. This barrier has proven difficult for therapists to manage. Furthermore, in order to do this training effectively, therapists need to sit low at the edge of a treadmill and to manu- ally move the limbs of the patient to match the treadmill motion. This manual approach has proven to be physically demanding, a source of fatigue, and has even resulted in musculoskeletal and joint injuries to therapists. Furthermore, the approach also requires that there be many therapists involved, typically three or four for a single training session, to minimize therapist fatigue, making the economics of the training plan uncertain at best. (This is because insurance plans in many countries will cover only a single therapist for one training session.)",

Position control\u2014in early studies, locomotion robots were often configured as position control systems, imposing rel- atively rigid patterns of joint angular motion on the lower extremities during walking. This approach appeared to have considerable value in non-ambulatory weak patients, in that it preserved joint range of motion, and imposed controlled yet beneficial loading on bone and muscle. However, as soon as some degree of locomotor recovery emerged, these position- controlled robotic systems have proven to be of less of obvious value. This is because the subjects routinely begin to relax, allowing the gait trainer to do the work for them. In this way, a key ingredient for recovery, which is engagement and involves active subject participation, is at least partly lost, and the clinical outcomes routinely suffer.",

To obtain maximum functional benefit it is necessary for subjects to regularly use ES systems both clinically and at home [14].

This first prototype of WNP elicited dor- siflexion in a hemiplegic foot and synchronized the application of electrotherapy with the swing phase of gait. Several researchers developed similar systems [17] and Vodovnik\u2019s group in Ljubljana systematically investigated the use of FES for the restoration of gait [18]. These systems used surface electrodes over the tibialis anterior and over the common peroneal nerve and a heel switch, worn in the shoe of the paretic side, was used to turn on the stimu- lation when the foot was lifted off the ground and off at heel strike. Standing can be obtained with surface ES of the quadriceps alone [19] even if better results have been obtained by also stimu- lating the hip extensor [20].",

These subjects were able to walk in parallel bars or with the aid of a roller walker for shorter distances. Starting from these first studies, several systems have been developed thanks to the advances in ES technology (e.g. elec- trodes, electronics, control) obtaining more complex and efficient stimulation [11, 17].\n\nThe first lower limb surface ES system Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved and commercially available was the Parastep developed by Sigmedics (www.sigmedics.com) and based upon work by Graupe [22]. It used 12 electrodes placed over the back, gluteals, and lower extremities and a walker with hand controls to regulate standing and sitting. Standing and walking for short distances is a very demanding task for patients with SCI at T4/T11 level, even using the Parastep [23\u201324]. Nevertheless, the Parastep has been used in approximately 400 patients for independent short-distance ambulation with positive physical and psychological benefits, making it an important option for thoracic-level traumatic paraplegics [25].",

It has four stimulation channels (three to generate grasping func- tion and one to stimulate the triceps brachii muscle and to allow elbow extension). The grasping function (i.e. hand opening and closing) is externally controlled through a push button. The sub- ject\u2019s shoulder velocity, measured through a goniometer, was used to stimulate the triceps brachii muscle and to control the reach- ing function. The Belgrade Grasping System was tested in eight subjects with chronic tetraplegia and it resulted in an improve- ment in hand grasping activity [58]. Concerning its therapeutic efficiency, it was tested in 12 chronic tetraplegics with a complete sensory\u2013motor lesion at C5/C6 level shoulder [58]. This GNP was marketed as ActiGrips System and it has been commercially avail- able since 2003. Even if they provided interesting performance in terms of motor recruitment, all the above mentioned GNPs were characterized by common drawbacks such as: risk of generate undesired movements due to a limited muscle selectivity, muscle fatigue, difficulty in control, in donning and doffing the devices, and in the electrode positioning [69]. Despite these drawbacks, GNPs based on transcutaneous electrodes are by far least invasive and are therefore regularly used for therapeutic applications of ES (TES) [14, 68, 70\u201372].",

    "text": "The Freehand is an implantable device developed with the main aim to restore lateral and palmar grasps in subjects with C5-C5 tetraplegia [82\u201383]. This implantable GNP is based on a fully implantable stimulator located in the subject\u2019s anterior chest. The stimulator is connected with eight epimysial or intramuscular electrodes implanted near motor points of hand and forearm mus- cles. The stimulator communicates with and external program- mable control unit by means of a radiofrequency transmitting coil. An additional sensor detects contralateral shoulder move- ments and uses this signal to control the opening and closing of the hand. The system has been implanted in more than 250 tetra- plegic patients (C5 and C6 level) [8] . From the results of a multi- center study with 51 C5 and C6 tetraplegic subjects [84] and other small studies [85\u201386], the Freehand was able to improve pinch force and grasp release abilities, resulting in a greater independ- ency in performing ADLs. Patients expressed satisfaction [84] and the implant seemed very robust to failure (i.e. a survival rate of 98.7% considering 238 electrodes implanted for a time ranging from 3 years up to 16 years [87]). Despite these promising clini- cal results, the Freehand was not commercially available since 2011. A second version, not yet commercially available, has been recently developed (Figure 30.4) [88]. This new version increased the number of stimulation electrodes (i.e. from 8 to 12 allowing better upper limb functions such as forearm pronation and reach- ing by elbow extension) and it allows the recording of electromyo- graphy (EMG) from two muscles. One of the main improvements is the possibility to control the GNP with ispilateral muscles (i.e. wrist",

Recent experiments in monkeys [93\u201394] showed that using multisite intraspinal ES it is possible to restore coordinated acti- vation of multiple muscles and control reaching and grasping movements.

The percutaneous approach (such as the NEC FESMate [96]) seems able to over- come some limits of surface electrodes (i.e. better selectivity, reduced pain, lower stimulation currents, reduced donning and doffing time) even if it is not suitable for long-term clinical use and it is afflicted by an increased risk of electrode break- age and infection. Finally, implantable systems (e.g. Freehand [83]) seem a solution that can be used in long-term clinical use thanks to a reduced risk of damage and infection, a low rate of failure [8, 11, 85], high selectivity of muscle stimulation, greater ADLs independence, better grasp, hold, and release, and high satisfaction. Of course, implantable systems require an addi- tional surgery for the implantation of the GNP, a risk of tissue growth affecting the nerve, and high costs.",

Exercises based on TES induce some positive physiological changes and in particular they can prevent osteoporosis, muscle atrophy, increase of body fat mass, and car- diovascular complications. Moreover, TES can promote/facilitate motor relearning and reduce spasticity and shoulder pain [13]. Exercises can be induced using body weight support devices or arm or leg cycle ergonomoters. Examples of arm or leg-cycle ergometers are the ERGYS (Therapeutic Alliances Inc., Fairborn, OH), the R300 (Restorative Therapies, Baltimore, MD), and the MotoMed (Reck-Technik, Betzenweiler, Germany). These systems combined stationary leg-cycle ergometer with surface ES to allow persons with little or no voluntary leg movement (e.g. SCI) to actively ped- alling. Moreover, some of the above cited GNPs or WNPs or HAS can also be used not only to restore motor functions but also as a therapeutic systems. Finally, more sophisticated approaches for ES-based therapeutic exercises are based on robotic devices able to compensate arm or body weight [2] . One example combines a multichannel surface electrical stimulator applied to distal mus- cles in order to provide grasp and release movements of the hand, with a commercial robotic exoskeleton (ArmeoSpring, Hocoma AG) to provide gravity compensation of the shoulder and elbow [97]. A different system for the lower limb (RT600, Restorative Therapies, Baltimore, MD) combines two motorized footplates and a partial body weight support with the surface ES of leg and gluteal muscles in order to support stepping and standing.",

However, despite much promise, ES-based neuroprostheses are lim- ited by the tedious donning and doffing of stimulation electrodes and sensors, manual control parameter adjustment, fast onset of\n\nfatigue, physical therapist support. Clinicians often find the systems to be time consuming and overly complicated to use. Therefore, although ES technology has been used for decades and its benefits widely published, its use in the clinic is largely absent. To improve the situation it is necessary to increase the efficacy of the devices and their clinical usability. For example, non-invasive solutions have to provide an easy way for donning and doffing and for customizing the stimulation parameters. At the same time, more invasive solu- tions (based on peripheral or spinal stimulation) are still far from an extensive clear demonstration of clinical efficacy. Problems such as long-term usability and selectivity need to be addressed before an extensive clinical application could become possible.",

For instance, new robotic-based training methodologies have emerged that promise to improve rehabilitation of patients who are unable to perform motor activities (walking, reaching, grasping). Examples of such patients are stroke survivors and SCI patients. Studies have shown that such robotic assistive devices can lead to very posi- tive therapeutic outcomes. Despite the promise of robot-assisted therapy, a number of disadvantages limit its widespread use in the clinic. Such therapy mainly provides passive movements of limbs, which leads to low activity of muscles and metabolism. Moreover, robotic systems can lead to abnormal muscle activation patterns. Also, robotic gait trainers for rehabilitation generally lack actu- ated ankle joints. Such actuation is difficult to implement as appli- cation of high torque to the feet may be dangerous. Individual limitations of the robotic and ES therapies can be eliminated by combining the two modalities. Immediate advantages include promotion of normal muscle activation, the possibility for prac- tice of normal patterns earlier during rehabilitation, reduced requirements on physical therapist support, and ankle/hand acti- vation. The current studies show that there is interest in combined ES-robotic trainers, but that research and development are very much in the initial stages.",

Nearly a million individuals in North America live with spinal cord injury (SCI), half of whom have tetraplegia [2]. Up to 60% of these people find it hard or impossible to perform activities of daily life (ADLs) because of poor upper limb (UL) function [3]. The main deficits are poor control of the proximal muscles, difficulty extending the elbow and wrist, difficulty in grasping (and particularly in releas- ing objects), and in about 30% of cases, significant to severe spas- tic hypertonus. Spastic hypertonus develops in 20\u201330% of stroke survivors 6 to 18 months post-stroke [4\u20137]. Spastic hypertonus is associated with reduced range of motion (ROM), pain, and con- tractures [8, 9]. Several studies have shown that spasticity can impede ADLs [5, 6, 10].",

Hand function, including dextrous manipulation, is at the top of the \u2018wish-list\u2019 of stroke sur- vivors and individuals with tetraplegia due to SCI [12, 13]. In fact, a recent questionnaire survey of 220 stroke survivors found that the most important outcome was the ability to use the paretic arm in meaningful ways [13, 14]. One person said \u2018It is a big deal to be able to use your arm again. I think most of the doctors think it is not. It is a big deal to be able to use your arm again psychologically as well as physically\u2019 [13: p. 1217].

This has forced thera- pists to focus more on compensatory strategies than on restoring function.

Compensatory strategies may, however, inhibit spon- taneous functional recovery. For example, stroke survivors often lean forward from the hip to position the more affected hand to grasp or stabilize objects. It has been argued that once compensa- tory strategies become habitual, they lead to \u2018learned non-use,\u2019 a form of motor neglect [30].

Movements of the less-affected UL are constrained for 6\u20137 hours for 2 weeks, forcing the more affected UL to be used in intensive practice of tasks relevant to the subject [3, 32]. The Stroke Rehabilitation Evidence-Based Review (SREBR) endorses this approach: \u2018Exposure to stimulating and complex environ- ments and involvement in tasks or activities that are meaningful to the individual with stroke serves to increase cortical reorgani- zation and enhance functional recovery\u2019 [33\u201335]. Other features of CIMT are \u2018shaping\u2019 (gradually increasing the difficulty of tasks) and a \u2018transfer package:\u2019 a behavioural contract specify- ing post-treatment activities. An important limitation of CIMT is that subjects must have at least 20\u00ba of voluntary wrist extension and 10\u00ba voluntary finger extension [32]. This excludes 85\u201390% of people with hemiparetic hands [33, 36]. There is disagree- ment on whether the strategy of preventing the less-affected arm from taking part in intensive exercise therapy is beneficial or not.

Pressure for reim- bursement has risen as a result of a multi-centre trial confirming that\n\nTendon transfer surgery It is important when evaluating novel devices that enhance UL function, to be aware of the existing medical alternatives. One of these is surgically to shift the tendon of a muscle that remains under voluntary control from its original attachment to a new one, to replace the action of a paralysed muscle [47]. A recent survey found that 70% of tetraplegic people who had received tendon transfers were satis\ufb01ed with the results, 77% reported a positive impact on their lives, 68% reported improvements in ADLs, 66% reported improved independence, and 69% reported improve- ment in occupation [48]. Tendon transfers are only available in specialized centres. Less than half of the 137 tetraplegic people recently surveyed had ever been told about this option and only 9% had had the procedure [12]. Nearly 80% said they would be will- ing to spend 2\u20133 months being less independent while recovering from surgery, ultimately to become more independent. Tendon transfers carry the risk of infection and involve several months of recovery during which motor function is actually reduced. The movements that are restored may not be as natural as antici- pated, and although in principle, tendon transfers are reversible, this involves more surgery. Because abnormal connective tissue growth and changes in muscle and tendon will have occurred, the anatomical relationship will not be completely restored. This can be a disincentive to people hoping for a \u2018cure\u2019.",

Affordable VR devices from the computer gaming world have recently been adapted for motor rehabilitation, most notably the Nintendo Wii [80\u201384]. The Wii allows users to play computer games with a hand-held motion sensor.

The resistance to movement presented by real objects in tasks of daily life is also lacking. In spite of these shortcomings, a recent study suggests that VR games played on the Wii provide a safe, feasible, and potentially effective alternative to facilitate reha- bilitation therapy and promote motor recovery after stroke [85]. The Wii has been embraced by rehabilitation clinics around the world, showing the need for affordable in-home devices that make exercise therapy enjoyable and thereby increase adherence.",

A recent meta-analysis [35] concludes: \u2018Sensorimotor training with robotic devices improves functional and motor outcomes of the shoulder and elbow, how- ever, it does not improve functional and motor outcomes of the wrist and hand.\u2019 This could be partly due to the fact that the exist- ing devices do not exercise dextrous hand movements. Another factor that has only recently been recognized is the tendency of clients whose movements are assisted by robots, to take advantage of the assistance and progressively reduce their own effort [96]. This has been termed \u2018slacking.\u2019 Unfortunately it has also been shown that it is the client\u2019s own effort that is the key to functional improvement with exercise training [97], The aforementioned robotic systems cost from $60K to $150K and require dedicated personnel within a clinical setting. A simpler robot, the \u2018Hand Mentor,\u2019 comprises a powered wrist splint. This device exercises hand and wrist only. In a recent small-scale RCT (n = 17) of the Hand Mentor, the rating of mood increased more in a group that used the device in addition to repetitive task practice than in a group receiving repetitive task practice only. Other outcome measures were similar in the two groups [98].",

The simplest of these are servo motors that impose repetitive, continuous passive movements on limbs [86, 87]. In some cases attachments are provided that mimic objects found in ADLs (PrimusRS: btetech.com; E-Link: www.biometric- sltd.com). The MIT-Manus rehabilitation robot provides arm sup- ports and applies planar forces that assist or resist voluntary motion during target-tracking on a monitor [88, 89]. In an important recent study of 127 chronic stroke participants, in those who did 36 hours of MIT-Manus robot-assisted exercise over 12 weeks, UL func- tion improved by about the same amount as in those who received equivalent therapist-supervised intensive training and in those who received usual care [90]. In their discussion of this disappoint- ing outcome, the authors noted that their participants received an unexpectedly large amount of additional rehabilitation, pos- sibly reflecting self-selection of highly motivated people or better access to rehabilitative services in the Veterans Administration system within which the study was conducted. Another factor was the inclusion of severely impaired participants: the mean baseline Fugl-Meyer score was 20 (out of a full range of 66). Functional out- comes of intensive exercise therapy in individuals with low levels of motor function are generally lower than in those with moderate to mild impairment at baseline (see later).",

Costs must be carefully weighed against the anticipated benefits. Low-cost, structured, conventional exer- cise programmes, exemplified by the GRASP protocol, are being increasingly adopted in both the clinic and outpatient settings, but because the exercises tend to be repetitive and uninteresting, adherence can be a problem. Wearable, spring-loaded splints are of relatively low cost and may improve motor function during reha- bilitation. In principle, they could also be useful as aids to daily living, but their current appearance and bulk may be a barrier for some potential users. FES splints such as the Bioness H200 are increasingly being used in rehabilitation clinics, and FES wristlets currently under development may enable outpatient usage in ADLs as well. Implantable FES devices hold promise, but they are relatively costly and still in the experimental stage. VR exer- cise therapy has grown rapidly in recent years with the advent of low-cost gaming devices such as the Nintendo Wii and the Xbox Kinect. These devices were not developed for rehabilita- tion and they do not involve dextrous tasks, nor interaction with real-life objects. They are mainly useful for improving whole-arm ROM. The gaming aspect of VR training is now recognized as a key factor in motivating clients and maintain- ing their adherence to exercises. Various robotic UL rehabili- tation devices incorporating VR gaming have been developed over the last 25 years. They are expensive and therefore they are only found in well-funded clinics.

Conventional approaches to treatment were dis- cussed, and current and emerging technologies that may enhance function, such as active mechanical orthoses and FES devices, were described. Surface FES systems that augment simple hand grasp\u2013release are increasingly seen as useful adjuncts to therapy, particularly in the subacute stages of recovery after stroke or SCI. Their long-term use in ADLs is less common, but with the advent of convenient, low-cost systems that can be voluntarily triggered and used independently in the outpatient setting, this mode of usage may expand in the coming years. Exercise therapy has been identified as being crucial in maximizing the functional outcomes after stroke and SCI. Numerous technological approaches have been proposed to improve adherence to exercise programmes, including computer gaming with purpose-designed rehabilitation robots as well as passive devices. Tele-supervised in-home reha- bilitation is still in its early stages, but will probably become an important part of rehabilitation in the future. The costs/benefits ratio will no doubt determine the eventual success or failure of the various technological approaches discussed.",

    "text": "Introduction The loss of mobility due to sensorimotor dysfunction of the lower extremities has devastating effects on the quality of life of affected individuals and their ability to remain independent in the com- munity. This in particular applies to patients with neurological gait disorders of the central nervous system (CNS) like stroke, Parkinson\u2019s disease (PD), multiple sclerosis (MS), or spinal cord injury (SCI). Stroke is one of the most prevalent neurological con- ditions worldwide (1.1 million first strokes per year in Europe) and the leading cause for persistent disabilities in adults [1] . Moreover, the burden of stroke is high and is likely to increase in future dec- ades [2]. A stroke is typically followed by a hemiparesis, which frequently affects walking function. In stroke rehabilitation gait restoration has high priority, since mobility is a key prerequisite for independence. Hemiparesis, in combination with the unstead- iness to walk, promotes reduced motor activities, resulting in fur- ther gait deterioration, acceleration of cardiovascular diseases, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. Therefore, the ultimate aim of gait rehabilitation is to provide patients an efficient and safe walking ability. Another patient group with severe restrictions of walking function are PD patients. More than 1 million people in the United States suffer from PD, which affects approximately 1 in 100 Americans older than 60 years [3]. In most patients the first symptoms appear in the age between 50 and 60, and 5\u201310% of the affected persons are younger than 40 [4]. Gait is one of the most affected motor characteristics of this disorder, although symp- toms of PD vary. The gait pattern in PD is characterized by small shuffling",

Compensation means that lost motor functions are substituted by other, preserved func- tions or by assistive technology. Restoration means that a weak or lost function is recovered by training. Compensation is the pre- ferred approach in the rehabilitation of individuals with severe CNS injuries, such as motor and sensory complete SCI. Adaptive equipment and/or neuroprostheses based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) are employed as compensatory strategies [7] to perform functional activities and to increase the level of inde- pendence in individuals with persistent handicap.

In patients with little or maximal impairment the choice of compensation versus restoration is rather easy, whereas in persons with moderate impairments the boundaries of compen- sation and restoration become indistinct. In other instances, com- pensatory strategies support restorative efforts: Compensatory walking aids like braces may improve the knee or ankle joint sta- bility and thus allow a person with substantially preserved vol- untary motor function to take part in a restorative gait therapy. In any case, technology plays an important role in the implemen- tation of both strategies in the clinical as well as the domestic environment.",

PD patients receive treadmill training to improve their hypokinesia-induced gait impair- ment [12]. Besides positive effects related to walking speed and endurance, normalization of the muscular activation pattern, and improved capability for weight bearing reductions in spas- ticity and increases in cardiopulmonary efficiency have also been shown following BWSTT [13]. It has to be noted that most of these studies included subjects in the subacute or chronic stage. A rand- omized, controlled multicentre clinical trial comparing 12 weeks of manual-assisted BWSTT with conventional overground gait training in acute subjects (incomplete SCI patients within 8 weeks post trauma) did not find differences in walking speed and dis- tance nor the locomotor subscore of the Functional Independence Measure [14] between the two groups 6 months after study inclu- sion [15]. Interestingly, both treatment groups showed much bet- ter outcomes compared to a historic control group. The authors discuss that both the treadmill and the conventional gait training group received a much higher therapy intensity and duration than those usually applied in clinical routine [16].",

    "text": "Neurobiological basis for an effective locomotor training It has been proposed for more than 250 years that activity patterns for locomotion originate from segmental spinal circuits. But it was the work of Sherrington [17] and Brown [18] in the beginning of the 20th century that truly moved this field forward. In these studies, they found that, with appropriate sensory stimuli from the periphery, spinalized cats generated patterned movements that mimicked those exhibited during swing and stance phases of locomotion. What they originally termed \u2018the intrinsic factor\u2019 has now become known as the central pattern generator (CPG). The CPG is a cluster of neuronal networks in the CNS, including the spinal cord, that can generate basic rhythmical motor patterns. These networks play an important role in tasks such as chewing and breathing and are also involved in the generation of the flex- ion and extension patterns during walking [19]. Recent clinical studies confirm older observations showing that in humans the pattern generator networks for walking are located in the lower thoracic and upper lumbar spinal cord comparable to findings obtained in several animal species [20, 21].",

This neuronal network needs sufficient input from supraspinal respectively cortical neurons to receive some sort of pushing signal for generation of a walking pattern [22]. Additionally, afferent feedback from the periphery is necessary to continuously adapt the weighting of pre-programmed patterns, so called movement primitives [23], to the actual envi- ronmental conditions [24]. In this context, some stimuli seem to be more efficient in activating the CPG than others. It has been shown in complete SCI subjects that the physiological movement of the hip joint, in particular the extension at the end of the stance phase, and the appropriate gait-phase related loading of the foot soles are the key trigger sources of the spinal gait pattern generator [25]. Based on the findings about the functionality of the locomotor pattern genera- tors additional experiments with spinalized cats and rats have been performed, which proofed that the CPG can be trained by appropri- ate paradigms and that herewith a better functional outcome can be achieved [26]. The reason for these improvements is the live-long ability of the CNS for reorganization of neural connections, so called neuroplasticity [27]. This ability for adaptation and learning is not only present in the brain, but also in the spinal cord. A recent experi- ment in cats applied a sequential dual-lesion paradigm consisting of: (1) an initially unilateral hemisection of the spinal cord at a level well rostral to the CPG located in the lumbosacral segments, result- ing in an incomplete paralysis of the hindlimbs; and (2) a complete injury 3 weeks later two segments",

Directly after the hemisection the cats showed an altered gait pattern at both hindlimbs, which normalized by gait training in the next 3 weeks. Immediately after complete spinalization cats showed normal hindlimb locomotion without any pharmacological stimu- lation. This indicates that the incomplete spinal injury had induced plastic changes within the spinal circuitry below the level of lesion, such that the CPG was already primed to re-express locomotion after the complete SCI [28].",

Moreover, the frequency and duration of practice correlates with the level of motor per- formance. Thus, repetition represents the key factor for success- ful motor learning. Although this may be the most effective way to improve short term performance during the training session, it is not sufficient for retaining motor skills over time. A set of factors\u2014called principles of motor learning\u2014have been identified that contribute to the long-term retention of a newly acquired skill (Table 32.1) [29]. Among them are the degree of active participa- tion and motivation of the patient, an appropriate intrinsic and extrinsic feedback, the adaptation of the complexity of the move- ment task, and contextual interference, in which variability and diversification of the movement tasks are explicit components of the gait training.",

A systematic evaluation of BWSTT variables in stroke patients revealed that a faster walking speed with body weight support ranging from 35\u201350% lead to the most physiological gait pattern [30]. The most effective afferent stimuli for activation of the CPG have been iden- tified by studying the muscular activation patterns in individu- als with complete SCI during systematic variation of the degree of hip extension and of foot loading [25]. It was shown that hip extension initiated swing phase and that a sufficient degree of foot loading is necessary to elicit a CPG efferent output. Based on these results it can be concluded that the degree of body weight support should be adjusted to the minimal amount of support with the caveat that joint overloading (like hyperextension of the knee) needs to be avoided. A poorly documented detail in studies using BWSTT is the use of handrails and details on the mechani- cal design of the weight support system, in particular the design of the attachment point(s) of the overhead suspension. With only one attachment point, which does not restrict rotational move- ments, the individual to be trained on the treadmill may have a hard time to stabilize in the transversal plane, in particular with higher degrees of body weight support. In those cases handrail use is mandatory to achieve a physiological gait pattern. In case a patient shows improvements during the rehabilitation process, based on practical experience it is advisable to first increase tread- mill speed until",

The main aim of these developments was to free therapists from the exhausting work of manually assisting the stepping movements and to perform a therapy in a more standardized fashion (Figure 32.2). The active components of the robots consist mainly of electric motors or pneumatically driven actuators in combination with spindles, gears, or bowden cables. Pneumatic actuators have the advan- tage of inherent lower stiffness, which reduces the risk of injuries. However, if they are used in highly dynamic configuration, they consume a high amount of compressed air and need sophisticated controllers to compensate their nonlinearities.

Examples of machines based on the end-effector approach for the lower extremity is the Gait Trainer (RehaHesse, Berlin, Germany) and the more sophisticated G-EO (Reha Technology, Olten, Switzerland) [38, 39]. Their main advantage is their easy setup, since no technical joint axes of the device have to be aligned with the axes of the anatomical joints. Furthermore, they only use one or two drives per extremity to generate a two-dimensional planar motion. With the G-EO device walking and stair climbing/ascending can be trained in the same therapy session without adaption of the machine (Figure 32.3). However, in end-effector devices the movements originate from the most distal segment of the extremity and therefore\u2014though the kinematic movement pattern looks similar to the physiologi- cal situation\u2014the kinetics of the generated movements may not be perfectly physiological. However, this seems to be crucial for the success of the therapy [25]. Additionally, in end-effector based robots only information about forces and/or position of the most distal part of the extremity is available, which may be too unspe- cific for control of a physiological kinetic and kinematic move- ment trajectory. For separation of the complex movement task of a physiological, reciprocal gait pattern into single, less complex subtasks the degree of support has to be separately adjustable for each joint. A physiological movement of all joints of an extremity can only be achieved by the use of active drives, which support the movements of the main DOF of a dedicated joint.

Therefore robotic locomotion training machines are mainly generating movements in the sagittal plane, whereas movements in the frontal or trans- versal plane are not supported or even restricted. However, many patients have weak leg abductor and adductor muscles and prac- titioners often wish to have the possibility for robotic training of these muscle groups, which are highly relevant for a physiological walking pattern.

A pilot study incorporating this con- trol scheme shows promising results [46]. Nevertheless, until now none of these prototypically implemented, highly sophisticated control concepts have found their way into routine clinical appli- cations.

Apparently, in non-ambulatory patients the training intensity in respect to the number of repetitions seems to be important for improvement, whereas in ambulatory patients other factors con- tributing to an enhanced locomotor performance (Table 32.1) become more relevant [52]. A clear disadvantage of the robotic devices currently used in clinical routine is the lack of an assist-as- needed control scheme, which does not sufficiently challenge the patient. Device developers have to keep in mind that during training the task has to be repeated, not the movement. In con- clusion, the principles of motor learning (Table 32.1) have to be implemented more consequently into robotic devices to improve the effectiveness of robotic locomotion therapies in ambulatory patients. An appropriate feedback functionality and control algo- rithms allowing for deviations from the uniform walking pattern might be key components for an improved therapy. It has to be emphasized that a robot alone does not represent a stand-alone tool, which promotes gait rehabilitation through all stages of rehabilitation. Moreover, its full potential can only be utilized if robotic tools are embedded in a comprehensive gait therapy con- cept [50, 53].",

Therefore, these parameters may\n\nbe used for documentation and guidance of the rehabilitation process. More importantly, real-time analysis of acquired sensor data and direct feedback of selected parameters to users brings new perspectives to gait rehabilitation [60]. Besides impaired motor function patients with relevant neurological disease con- ditions suffer frequently from concomitant sensory deficits, in particular proprioceptive sensory dysfunction (altered position/ vibration sense), with resulting gait ataxia. Even patients with substantial motor functions are in most instances unable to com- pensate the lack of proprioception through vague visual (mirror) or auditory feedback (therapist instructions), or through physi- cal guidance of impaired extremities. In addition, feedback pro- vided by therapists may vary over time and between therapists. The principle of instrumented, augmented feedback, in which impaired proprioception is substituted by providing additional external information, may help to overcome these problems [61]. The overall goal of feedback is to promote relevant, persistent and transferable improvements in gait function.

Following this concept a gait variable (e.g. step length on one side while walking on a treadmill) is visually fed back to the user and gradually distorted over time. In healthy subjects a systematic modulation of step length away from symmetry could be achieved without explicit knowledge of the manipulation [63]. Studies examining the role of the focus of attention in healthy subjects have consistently demonstrated that instructions inducing an external focus (directed at the movement effect) are more effective than those promoting an internal focus (directed at the body movements) [64]. However, patients with sensory-motor impairments may not always benefit from feedback in the same way healthy subjects do, as they often comprehend how to influence a pathological movement, but are physically not able to [62]. Therefore, in patients with more severe impairment it may be advisable to start with less complex feedback of the move- ment performance of a single joint. As soon as the performance improves, the quality of the feedback provided will be gradually shifted towards the success of the movement task. The latter seems to facilitate automaticity in motor control, which is the ability to walk without continuously thinking about its low-level details, and to promote the energy-efficiency of movements.",

In particular, infor- mation about long-term carry over effects of feedback training is missing. Few studies select their feedback strategies and para- digms implemented in locomotion robots according to the prin- ciples and concepts of motor learning (Table 32.1). For example, feedback, which is continuously provided, does not support but rather blocks the learning process [70, 71]. Moreover, the infor- mation content of the feedback has to be carefully adapted to the cognitive capacity of the patient, since the performance of a movement task is decreasing during mental stress. Nevertheless, feedback-based rehabilitation strategies represent a very promis- ing and emerging field in gait rehabilitation of patients with pre- dominantly sensory dysfunction.",

It is the means by which they achieve inclusion and increases access to opportu- nities for education, employment, and participation within the home environment and the community. A manual wheelchair is designed for people who have enough upper-body, arm, and hand strength to self-propel the wheels of the chair.

The design criteria of a manual wheelchair strongly depend on its intended use and the level of activity of the end user (Figure 32.7). While it may be sufficient to have a heavy folding frame wheelchair for pure indoor use in persons with low activity level, a lightweight rigid frame wheelchair is the best choice for outdoor use in persons with a higher activity level. The latter can be handled by the users themselves for transportation in a car. A crucial factor for safety and comfort is the proper adjustment of the seating position. In long-term wheelchair users it is extremely important to find the correct position for optimal propulsion in order to avoid shoulder complications [74]. If wheelchairs are intended to be used over an extended period of time, it is advisable to use them in combination with seat cush- ions to avoid pressure sores. Seat cushions are available in a vari- ety of designs from simple foam cushions to complex pressurized, self-adjusting air cushions. The selection of the cushion mainly depends on the individual risk to develop pressure sores.",

    "text": "Introduction: community access The prevalence of disability is currently estimated to be about 15% worldwide with significant variations across countries [1] . This figure will increase over time due to various factors, including the ageing of the population, particularly in developing countries. However, as Stephen Hawking said, \u2018Disability need not be an obstacle to success\u2019 [1]. Individual accomplishment in the life of persons with disabilities (PWD) has much to do with: (1) effective participation in valued life activities, (2) achievement of culturally and developmentally appropriate social roles, (3) contribution to various aspects of community life, and (4) full citizenship. The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities [2] enshrines the right to full and effective participation, including rights to accessibility, to live independently and be included in the community, and to participate in political, public and cultural life, recreation and sports. The Convention also emphasizes that various types of environmental factors hinder or facilitate full and effective participation in society of PWD on an equal basis with others. This paradigm stems from a shift in the conceptualisation of disability, from individual responsibility for disabling situations (e.g. impairments causing disadvantages in social and economic life) to a person\u2013environment interactive process, such as depicted in contemporary disability models, including the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health [3] and the Disability Creation Process [4].",

Overall, efforts to provide better community access have led to limited success and a substantial\n\nnumber of PWD continue to face environmental barriers to their participation as equal members of society. An optimal analysis of factors that could enhance participation requires the use of a tax- onomy of environmental dimensions (e.g. physical, technological and social). Initial thinking regarding community access often focuses on physical access as defined by architectural and physi- cal elements in the environment (ramps, kerb cuts, etc.). However, this is only one aspect of a comprehensive vision of the environ- mental dimensions influencing participation [5] . Other envi- ronmental dimensions and community services that influence participation, include home care and support, primary health care, transportation, social and family support, education and job training, and technologies to enhance mobility, communication and home adaptation [1, 6, 7]. In some instances, social policies and programmes that regulate such dimensions vary from coun- try to country.",

The aim of this chapter is to identify and describe critical elements in the environ- ment that could contribute to optimal participation and to indicate how a favourable environment could facilitate participation. The main aspects considered are access to services and technology, as well as social policies. Since there are important variations in environmental and cultural issues across societies, this chap- ter focuses mainly on issues related to developed countries. Furthermore, many of the issues related to community access apply to PWD in general and not specifically to those with neuro- logical impairments.",

Indeed, PWD may have complex and continuing health care needs related to their primary medical condition or associated impairments [10], making the management of health care challenging. While specialised health care is sometimes necessary to treat complex conditions, in terms of primary health care, the needs of PWD require services similar to those of the general population. Such care is an essential component of the provision of services along the continuum of health care from promotion to curative and rehabilitative care [11].",

For example, severe bowel dysfunction is associated with barriers to personal relationships, feelings about self, and home life [14] while satisfac- tion with participation is consistently associated with a lower level of fatigue, pain, depression, stress, and anxiety [15].

Because of chronic medical conditions, there is a higher rate of primary health care utilization among PWD [20], even though access to health care is sometimes seen as a fight or an ongoing challenge on the continuum of health care [21].

Major barriers are associated with physical inaccessibility, poor communication by service providers, funding issues, and a lack of knowledge and expertise regarding disability. Physical accessibility of facilities and equipment can be an issue: for exam- ple, offices and clinics often do not have accessible examination tables and scales [23]. While building entrances are usually acces- sible, the interiors (narrow doorways, cluttered exam rooms, inaccessible bathrooms) may not be accessible to wheelchair users [24]. Reports suggest that clinic administrators\u2019 significant lack of knowledge regarding accessible medical equipment and disability regulations could partly explain why medical practices lack such equipment [25, 26].",

For example, they are more likely to think that service\n\nproviders do not treat them equally to persons without disabilities for aspects such as listening to them, explaining treatment or involving them in treatment decisions. Some barriers are more structural and involve a lack of alternative means of communi- cation such as large print or Braille materials and sign language interpreters for persons with sensory disabilities [28]. Overall, accessible communication means providing content in formats that are usable and understandable by persons with specific dis- abilities (vision, hearing, speech) or with limited ability to read or understand [29]. It also means ensuring a proper level of health literacy to facilitate decision-making and treatment instructions and follow-up. A lack of training for health care providers regard- ing how to care for PWD can also have a negative impact on health care coordination or quality [19, 28, 30]. This in turn can lead to a focus on people\u2019s disabilities rather than possible secondary complications or health problems, thus undermining primary health care.",

Affordability of services is a major issue even without disabili- ties, but PWD are more likely to experience a lack of affordable health care, even in developed countries [1] . This leads to post- poning efforts to seek health care or not buying needed medi- cations because they are too costly [20]. Furthermore, since PWD have lower rates of employment, they are less likely to be able to afford private health insurance or may be excluded from such insurance because of pre-existing conditions. Access to insurance is critical as uninsured PWD report more problems getting needed care or medications than their insured counter- parts [31].",

To enhance \u2018disability knowl- edge\u2019 among health care providers, dissemination of information to practitioners should be encouraged through initiatives such as the \u2018Actionable Nuggets\u2019 project [34] aimed at providing pri- mary care physicians with concise, but concrete, information on major issues related to the health of people with spinal cord injury. Moreover, encouraging the use of disability models is critical in ensuring that health care providers have a better understanding of the concept of functioning and participation as a crucial com- ponent of the definition of health that goes beyond disease and medical complications [35].",

    "text": "Home care services mean all the services required by PWD and provided in their home, with the aim of compensating for their functional disabilities and disabling situations in the daily life activities they need to perform to live in their regular home envi- ronment, with due respect for their personal choices. Home care services are generally divided into four categories [40]: physical help, domestic help, help within the community, and health care (Table 33.1).\n\nAccess to home care services within the framework of a person- centred or independent living model is an approach increasingly used to enable PWD to live and participate in the community. The Independent Living Movement has played an important role in keeping PWD, especially those with motor disabilities, in the community by advocating the principles of control over one\u2019s life and the services needed to carry out activities of daily living [36, 37]. This movement originated in the United States and then, in the late 1980s and 1990s, developed in Europe, especially in the Scandinavian countries [38, 39]. The importance of this phenom- enon is confirmed in the majority of post-industrial societies [40]. Generally, service recipients from the Independent Living Movement include persons with very severe physical disabilities, but this formula is also offered to persons with intellectual dis- abilities and mental health problems [39, 41, 42]. It takes different forms and has different names depending on the context, such as direct payments, personal assistance, personal budget, etc.",

Problems noted include aspects related to difficulties recruiting and train- ing workers and working conditions, or needs assessment, and the paternalistic control of professionals [39, 45\u201347]. In response to some of these difficulties, some American Independent Living centres have created training programmes for community work- ers in collaboration with various states. \u2018Most of these efforts are designed to establish a set of core standards and training programs for personal assistant services workers across the continuum of services and community-based settings\u2019 [37].

In addition, the declining number of births per family, which reduces the number of people who can support the family as a unit, the increasing number of divorces, and geographic mobil- ity as well as the changing demographics of parenting are other changes that have an impact on families, including its structure, access to family support, and the availability of mothers or other family caregivers.

This concept underscores the interdependence of the individuals who make up the family system. When one of them has a disability, all of them are affected and feel the effects. The family system must adapt to and cope with a situation where the unexpected high level of care and support needed is a burden on family caregivers, whose health and well-being can be jeopardised if they do not receive outside support.",

    "text": "From the viewpoint of interventions focusing on assisted resilience [51], support strategies act as protective factors that strengthen the family\u2019s resilience and help it respond positively to the challenges involved in meeting the specific needs of the child with disabilities. Growing out of the study of the positive adaptation of children to traumatic events and chronic adversity [52], the work on resilience expanded from looking at individual resilience to studying family, collective, and societal resilience [53]. McCubbin and McCubbin [54] were the first to examine family resilience by looking at the different characteristics that help families resist disruption in the face of change and adapt to crisis situations. Studying resilience helps to understand not only why some families manage to survive traumatic events and adversity, but also how they manage to grow and emerge stronger from the ordeal [55]. The concept of resilience is of great interest for family support services, especially with the emergence of the concept of \u2018assisted resilience\u2019 as distinct from natural resilience, which refers to the individual\u2019s and family\u2019s own strengths and abilities [53]. Assisted resilience interventions are characterized by: (1) focus on and development of the potential of individuals or families at risk; (2) identification of existing resources in the individual\u2019s or family\u2019s circle; and (3) implementation of preven- tion programmes and of a maieutic approach for intervention strategy.",

This is undoubtedly one of the most important and critical changes in practice in the past forty years towards true participation in community life. There is increasing discussion about inclusive education, as opposed to an emphasis on inclu- sive pedagogy. An inclusive approach, however, is still driven by differing trends and tensions that sometimes make it dif- ficult to address individual differences [56]. This move towards inclusivity is even more important when it involves returning to work or returning to the community after a trauma. The scien- tific community is particularly interested in this latter dimen- sion, given the great complexity of the process where a range of social and psychosocial variables influence the return to com- munity living [57\u201360]. This educational and employment issue has been widely addressed in recent years from the standpoint of social and community participation, which is marked by transi- tions, that is, critical moments in the life cycle of individuals. Many factors influence youth transitions [62] from secondary to post-secondary education and then to the workforce (Table 33.2).

Transition to adulthood for young adults with cerebral palsy and other disabilities is a difficult and sometimes delayed process. The transition from adolescence to adulthood has been examined by trying to establish a profile of the health and needs of groups of people with different diag- noses (cerebral palsy, spina bifida, and traumatic brain injury).

Larger study samples are required to ensure generalizability. Furthermore, participants need to use identical technologies (same brand and model) in a wide variety of environments and social contexts to achieve more robust assessments. For example, it is necessary to observe a group of subjects taking on a variety of social roles, assuming responsibilities and participating in the social life of the community, both with and without their assistive devices. Finally, it is important to note that ATCs, visual aids and EADLs are evolving far too rapidly to permit adequate and full testing of any one device. As a result, there are many studies that are \u2018non experimental\u2019, that is, do not include any form of direct interven- tion, control group or randomised controlled trial for the target population. Instead, these studies focus on user perceptions and clinical recommendations. Questionnaire-based surveys and qualitative methods [65, 68] are preferred for assessing reported use and perceptions. Efforts to evaluate specific devices tend to adopt an exploratory approach based on small group interven- tions without a control group [66] or sometimes they may adopt a cross-sectional design with a control group [64].

Two types of assistive technology are used in clinical settings: alternative augmentative communication (AAC) devices and communication devices for a minimally conscious state. AAC devices encompass communication methods used to sup- plement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by people with a wide range of speech and language impairments, including congenital impairments such as cerebral palsy and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclero- sis and Parkinson\u2019s disease. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person\u2019s communication programme or a temporary aid [76, 77]. The two most important elements appreciated by people who rely on AAC are: (1) saying exactly what they want to say, and (2) saying it as fast as they can. AAC devices have evolved dramatically over the past 30 years. Originally little more than printed tables of sym- bols to which the user pointed to communicate different messages, later versions exploited dedicated voice synthesizers. Modern AAC services are provided by portable computers, tablets and smart phones, and use a range of voice synthesizers (Figure 33.2).",

Furthermore, AAC devices and communication devices for the minimally conscious must be individually programmed and require many hours of training. As a result, studies involving large groups are extremely difficult to organise, let alone publish. Most studies present strategy choices rather than attempting to measure effects [77]. Furthermore, keeping up with new products poses additional challenges, especially for technologies that sup- port brain injury or stroke. Factors affecting the integration of aided communication in everyday life contexts are complex. For many adults, the lack of key supports, including the availability of communication partners, restricts the contexts in and extent to which aided communication is used.",

Injuries due to excessive use and acute injuries are among the issues commonly reported [94, 95].

The development of exoskeleton capability has, how- ever, taken a lot longer than originally expected and results today are still far from mature. Several suits have been successfully deployed in the laboratory under limited conditions and for short durations. Separate development efforts are underway for upper body and lower body exoskeletons, the needs of each are somewhat different. Exoskeleton devices are aimed at several applications, of which mobility devices for PWD are but one possible use. Other uses include for soldiers, for caregivers, construction, hazardous work environments, etc. Although costs for robotic components have dropped dramatically in recent years, the complex nature of these devices means that commercial availability of products at prices comparable to even high end wheelchairs or other mobility devices is unlikely for many years yet to come.",

For example, assis- tive devices like EADLs (e.g. a switch on a wheelchair that can be activated by a person to turn on different electronic devices) or stand-alone devices (e.g. radio passive infrared receiver and voice receiver) are single devices [114]. However, when technology refers to a simply connected system (e.g. a warden call button or a com- munity alarm) or a more complex system linked to an external infra- structure (e.g. a domestic device that interacts with a city-based infrastructure to support telecare services), it is more than a simple assistive device.

Another includes a communal kitchen area for a range of residents and has technology demonstrator sites in England, including the iHouse, with a number of scenarios to support cognitive and sen- sory impairments [119].",

These systems could help people with both motor and cognitive impairments. Smart homes with high levels of ambient intelligence can also schedule and organise household repairs, food and service deliveries [117]. No evidence yet exists concerning the impact of smart homes on social participation; these developments are complex to build and not enough have been implemented to support extensive impact studies. Instead, the scientific literature reports on project ideas and plans, technical prototypes, and the strengths and limitations of different smart home components. One common element can be found in most of these papers, however; even if different people have a similar diagnostic profile and present similar cognitive or motor limitations, each person has different needs in terms of home automation, personal safety, communication preferences, and telecare services. Hence, smart homes must be able to adapt to context, or must be designed around the specific needs of each client (e.g. use or not of specific assistive technologies, prompts, and reminders, what caregivers are able to provide by way of additional services, what can be monitored at a distance, and which tasks are amenable to automated or tele-operated strate- gies) [121]. Furthermore, both the type and quality of telecare services may raise ethical questions around privacy issues [122]. The most pressing objections against telecare are concerned with depersonalising care, increasing the isolation of patients, and using technology to achieve cost savings rather than health gains.",

An important challenge to ensure social change, however, is rooted in the fact that a fundamental shift needs to occur in culture, not just the culture of disability but, in a more expansive way, the culture of \u2018ability\u2019. Universal design is not aimed at designing",

    "text": "Finally, socioeconomic policies in relation to disability are shifting in a number of important ways. There is a growing recognition of the need to separate the provisions of social secu- rity for all citizens, which include insurance for basic costs asso- ciated with disability, from the additional and endemic costs of engaging in full participation while living with disability, costs which can be both individual but also societal. An example of the latter is the lower income typical for PWD\u2014hence compen- sation for disability needs to incorporate awareness of systemic income disparities that also affect PWD. Another recent change among developed countries has been to offer more direct pay- ment programmes in lieu of access to services, which allows PWD a choice among different service providers. The approach emphasizes the increasing autonomy available to PWD as a result of the changes under way, a net gain if nothing compro- mising emerges. There are fears, however, that direct payment schemes may abrogate responsibility on the part of government towards the need to construct social and physical environments that are less disabling. The call for physical environments that meet the requirements of universal design offers an example of the pressure on states to ensure full participation and citizenship.",

The term \u2018virtual reality\u2019 (VR) was popularized in the late 1980s by Jaron Lanier, one of the pioneers of the field. At the same time, also the term \u2018artificial reality\u2019 came up. The Encyclopaedia Britannica describes VR as \u2018the use of computer modelling and simulation that enables a person to interact with an artificial three-dimensional (3D) visual or other sensory environment\u2019 [1] . Furthermore, it states that \u2018VR applications immerse the user in a computer-generated environment that simulates reality through the use of interactive devices, which send and receive information and are worn as goggles, headsets, gloves, or body suits\u2019 [1]. For example, a user wearing a head-mounted display with a stereo- scopic projection system can view animated images of a virtual environment. The immersion is enhanced by the use of motion sensors that pick up the user\u2019s movements and adjust the view on the visual display in real-time accordingly; the user can even pick up and manipulate virtual objects that she or he sees through the visual display, and also wearing data gloves that are equipped with joint angular position sensors, or even with force-feedback mod- ules that provide the sensation of touch [1]. Thus, VR usually refers to a technology designed to provide interaction between user and artificially generated environments. This interaction is supposed to be more natural, direct, or real than pure simulation technolo- gies delivering only numerical or simple graphical outcomes.",

Feedback allows patients to evaluate their movement success as well as detect potential movement errors [2, 3]. Concepts that are mostly being deployed are, for example, verbal feedback and mirrors placed in front of the patients, giving visual and/or acoustic feedback [4] . Other approaches include bio- feedback\u2014processes that monitor a patient\u2019s performance using physiological measurements [5]. With the advent of modern media technologies, also the technology of \u2018augmented feedback\u2019 has nowadays become increasingly popular [6, 7]. Augmented feedback can be defined as \u2018the provision of supplementary sensory informa- tion (visual, auditory, or haptic) brought by technological means, which would not normally be present in the usual environment\u2019 [8]. A good overview of VR technologies applied to medicine has been presented by Riener and Harders [9]. That source serves as a basis for some of the chapters and text passages of this article.",

While the user interacts with the VR system, the two environments communicate and exchange information through a barrier called interface. The interface can be considered as a translator between the user and the VR system. When the user applies input actions (e.g. motion, force generation, speech, etc.), the interface translates these actions into digital sig- nals, which can be processed and interpreted by the system. On the other hand, the system\u2019s computed reactions are also translated by the interface into physical quantities, which the user can perceive through the use of different display and actuator technologies (e.g. images, sounds, feeling of touch, etc.). Finally, the user interprets this information and reacts to the system accordingly.",

Such modalities can be sound, vision, or touch. Communicating with multiple modali- ties is called multimodal interaction. Multimodal interaction allows several types of modalities to be simultaneously exchanged between the user and the virtual environment. The goal of apply- ing multimodal interaction is to provide a complete and realis- tic image of the situation, to give redundant information (e.g. for safety reasons), to increase the quality of presence, and to provide a more intensive stimulation of the human neurophysiological system, when applied to rehabilitation.",

Of course, the level of sickness depends on the susceptibility of the user. Symptoms can appear during the exposure to the VR and last for hours after the expo- sure. Technical issues may be main origins for cybersickness. For example, a 15 ms lag in a head-mounted display can already induce cybersickness in the user.",

Another factor influencing the motiva- tion is the kind of reward provided in order to keep the patient always engaged and interested [17, 18]. Last but not least, motiva- tion can also be affected by the difficulty level of the VR exercise.

Movement repetition is important both for motor learning and the corresponding cortical changes [11]. Active participation in gait training was shown to increase therapy outcome [12]. The same is true for the rehabilitation of the upper extremi- ties, when stroke patients are forced to use their paretic arm due to constraint induced movement therapy (CIMT) [13]. The repeated practice must also be linked to incremental suc- cess at some task or goal. In the intact nervous system, this is achieved by trial and error practice, with feedback about the performance success provided by the senses (e.g. vision, audi- tion, proprioception).",

Just by seeing the virtual environment can stimulate and invite the patient to get active just by intuition, without any fur- ther oral explanations given by the therapist. For instance, a vir- tual path in the nature, with a virtual ball lying on the ground, may stimulate the user to walk to the ball and shoot it away; or a table with a virtual bottle and an empty glass invites the subject to grasp the bottle and fill the glass. Furthermore, VR can be a good solution for training of dangerous tasks, which may be too difficult to train for in the real setting, such as special gait-related tasks (risk of falling) or use of edgy and sharp tools for different manipulative tasks (risk of arm/face injuries).",

    "text": "Recording of positions and movements For many VR applications it is required to measure positions and movements of body segments or objects used by the human operator [9] . Measurement of positions and movements can be based on resistive, capacitive, inductive, ultrasound, or opti- cal sensing principles. The position and movement measuring systems can be classified into three categories depending on structure and design. These are desktop systems, body-mounted systems, and contact-free systems. Desktop systems are designed for being used on a desk. Such devices are standard computer mice or game joysticks. More complex joystick-type devices exist that allow rendering of several degrees of freedom, for example in spatial (3D) range. Body-mounted sensing systems are usu- ally used to measure the posture or movement of the human. The equipment needs to be attached to the body of the subject (Figure 34.3). Examples are goniometers, gyroscopes, acceler- ometers, and inclinometers in order to measure angles, velocity, or acceleration, respectively. Inertial sensors, such as acceler- ometers and gyroscopes, are used to measure motion and ori- entation. Inertial sensors are widely applied in head-mounted displays to track the angular motion of the user\u2019s head. Goniometers are used to measure joint angles. Many versions are based on resistive measurement principles using potenti- ometers. Contact-free systems (remote systems) can capture the position and motion of the body in space without mechanical contacts between the subject and the sensing unit [23]. This type of sensing system is often preferable since it gives a large scope and the users are normally not encumbered by wires and bulky components. Several systems are based",

Presentation of 2D pictures can be performed by simple computer monitors or projection systems. For stereo rendering of graphical information different methods have been developed to present the correct stereo image to the respective eye [9] .\n\nOne method is to encode the images for the respective eyes via light polarization. Filters are employed to distinctly polarize the left- and right-eye stereo image. Users apply glasses with cor- responding polarization filters, thus, letting only the appropri- ately polarized images pass each filter. This display strategy can be implemented by using two projectors equipped with rotated linear polarizers. The rendered images are projected simultane- ously onto the same surface. Passive stereo glasses are worn, which contain matching rotated linear polarizers. Instead of polarization, also different colours (red/green, blue/green or only slightly shifted colours) can be used to distinguish the right and left image. Furthermore, stereoscopic images can be generated by head-mounted displays, or autostereoscopic screens, which do not require any glasses worn by the user.",

Moreover, additional users can participate in the viewing of the presented VR content [30]. The most immer- sive graphical display systems are those, where the user is placed inside of a virtual world, while blocking out cues from the real environment in order to obtain a sense of presence\u2014the feeling of actually being in the simulated environment. Two key examples in this category are cave-like setups and head-mounted displays. In the former a user stands inside a small room, whose walls are used as projection surfaces. The virtual world is displayed on the latter via rear-projection [31]. In the second immersive display type, a head-mounted setup is worn, which houses small screens in front of the eyes [32].

An important aspect to note about haptics is that it involves both a passive receptive and an active explorative component, thus, requiring bidirectional input and output. Tactile perception is related to the sense of touch, which includes the feeling of pressure, vibration, tempera- ture, and pain. The tactile cues are perceived by a variety of recep- tors located under the surface of the human skin. Each receptor responds to different stimuli.

Sound has made its way towards VR, where rendering of sound is used for creating virtual auditory environments analo- gous to graphics rendering [37]. There are two major principles to render the acoustic information to the virtual environment. The first principle is to display prerecorded sound samples. The sound samples are usually static and non-parameterized. To simulate different virtual situations, often a large number of sound samples are required. These different sound samples may be played simul- taneously or one after the other depending on the user activity and interaction with the virtual scenario. This principle is com- monly used to render the background scenario in virtual envi- ronments by adding for example, twittering birds, rushing waters, passing cars, a human audience, machine noise, or music. The second principle of sound rendering is either based on real-time synthesizing of sound sources as they are generated by the physi- cal properties of the sound emitting components and materials, or on modulating the sound signals as they appear in the vicinity of the ear of the listener [38].",

The process consists of two main steps: collision detec- tion and contact force computation. Collision detection is a pro- cess to detect the intersection occurring between the user (in the virtual environment) and the virtual object the user is interact- ing with. As soon as the interacting body part of the user (e.g. the user\u2019s fingertip, object hold and moved by the hand, foot, toe) penetrates the virtual object (e.g. a wall, surface of a desk, a static object), a collision between the user and the object takes place, which implies that the user touches the virtual object. Haptic devices must then render reaction forces that prevent the user from penetrating too deep into the virtual object. The rendered force should resemble the contact force when touching an equiva- lent object in a real scenario. Some basic haptic rendering tech- niques for rigid objects of simple geometry are presented in Riener and Harders [9] .",

Artificial intelligence is an important part of making realistic interactions in virtual environments. For example, a virtual tour of a historical site can be made more interesting by augmenting it with a virtual guide, who has the knowledge structure of the virtual site, but is also given a \u2018personality\u2019 so that the virtual guide can emulate a real guide [43].",

In a literature survey on the impact of computer games and serious games, it was found that knowledge acquisition/content understanding was a frequent outcome of games, suggesting that games might have a beneficial effect [45].\n\nReeve presents an introduction to narrative-based serious games [46]. According to Reeve, serious games have clear objectives for player achievement that are transferable to spaces outside the game world; they are rarely ends in themselves but mechanisms to improve skills in other domains. Within serious games, the role of the narrative becomes more pronounced because of the require- ment to deliver specific learning outcomes. Reeve categorized the types of narratives in games as follows [46]: (i) in linear traditional games the users must successfully complete a stage before receiv- ing the next episode of the game; (ii) in branching narrative games",

Storytelling can also be used to give serious games a specific form that is easy to understand [48].

    "text": "In an early work on the desirable characteristics of games, Malone [50] lists variable difficulty as one of the desirable fea- tures. According to Malone, good computer games should be playable at different difficulty levels, which can be chosen automatically by the game according to how well the player does, or can be chosen by the player [50]. The first idea, that the game chooses a difficulty level based on how well the player performs, is similar to the idea in flow theory of matching task challenge to user skill in order to sustain user motivation for a task [51]. The idea of automatically adjusting difficulty level of games has been very influential in shaping the design of seri- ous games over the last two decades. For example, different parts of a complex serious game can be individually adapted to match user performance. A more sophisticated machine learn- ing approach is to have game agents learn from their experience and adapt themselves in real-time based on user performance [52]. In another approach, game parameters and behaviours of computer-controlled opponents can be adapted in real-time according to the proficiency of the player in the game [53]. In an educational game, adaptation rules can be designed to examine learner performance and adapt a specific game scenario based on how well the learner is doing [54].",

There has been some debate about the role of rewards in affecting intrinsic motivation\u2014the inherent tendency to seek out novelty and challenges in games and not work towards rewards [56]. While some researchers opine that rewards negatively affect intrinsic motivation [57], others argue that there is no such nega- tive effect [58]. Nonetheless, rewards remain a key part of games, and are often related to the concept of scores, which are points awarded to users based on how well they perform in a game. Score motivates game play by rewarding behaviour and providing a gauge of performance, enabling comparison and competition [59]. The presence of high score lists in games has been argued to encourage user participation [60].",

    "text": "Virtual-reality supported physiotherapy Virtual-reality supported ankle rehabilitation At Rutgers University, Burdea and colleagues developed the VR-supported haptic device called \u2018Rutgers Ankle\u2019 [61]. The system consists of a hexapod platform as a haptic interface that provides forces in 6 degrees of freedom to the patient\u2019s foot, in response to his or her movement performance in a game-like VR exercise (Figure 34.5). The patient is treated in a sitting posture, with the foot attached via a footplate to the hexapod device. Two exercise games have been developed. In the first one, the patient uses the foot to steer a virtual airplane through a virtual sky. As the plane moves forward, a series of open square hoops are pre- sented on the screen. The goal is for the participant to manoeu- vre the plane through the hoops without hitting the sides. This is done by mapping the ankle movement to the flight path, where for instance ankle dorsiflexion can cause the nose of the plane to point upward, elevation can cause the plane to go toward the left, etc. The difficulty level can be adjusted by changing the number and placement of hoops, airplane speed, and the amount of resist- ance provided by the haptic interface. A second game calls for the participant to pilot a virtual speedboat over the ocean while avoiding buoys, again by moving the ankle up and down or in and out. A recent addition to these games is that the user can experience task-related haptic effects such as a jolt when a buoy or hoop is hit, or to change the environmental conditions by add- ing turbulence to the air or water implemented by generating a low-frequency side-to-side vibration of the platform. The Rutgers Ankle system has been validated on patients",

These symptoms tend to worsen as the disease progresses. Although the symptoms can be mitigated by drugs such as L-dopa, these drugs can become less effective over time and may produce unwanted side effects, such as chorea and athetotic movements. Thus, a complementary method to treat hypokinetic gait in Parkinson\u2019s disease could offer patients a way to delay or reduce drug use while still maintain- ing or even improving gait function. Such an alternative method is based on an interesting phenomenon associated with patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease termed kinesia paradoxa. Patients with Parkinson\u2019s disease, who are unable to ambulate, or even unable to initiate a step on open ground are, paradoxically, able to step over objects placed in their path with little difficulty. Weghorst and col- leagues have conducted a number of studies to ascertain, whether VR technology provides a way to take advantage of this phenom- enon and facilitate walking in Parkinson\u2019s disease patients by pre- senting virtual objects overlaid on the natural world [71]. Several other technologies have been developed and applied to assist Parkinson patients during daily life activities (see later).",

When the foot impacts the virtual wall, the graphical and haptic displays show the foot contact with the wall with a minimal time shift to the acoustics.\n\nThe Lokomat system can also serve as a haptic display that ren- ders the force interaction between the user\u2019s foot and a virtual object [79, 82] (Figure 34.6). As the Lokomat was not built to be used as a haptic display, it only has motors at the hip and knee joints, whereas the ankle joint cannot be actuated. Therefore, con- tact forces on the toes cannot be displayed directly. Nevertheless, it is possible to produce a quasi-realistic haptic perception by trick- ing the tactile system with synchronized visual and acoustic cues into believing the interaction would happen at the toes. Impedance control is normally used to display haptic objects in the virtual environment. Typical sampling times for haptic rendering lie in the range of 500\u20131000 Hz. Below 500 Hz, the rendering of stiff objects may become unstable. The haptic rendering has been directly included within the Lokomat control architecture.

Besides the visual feedback, auditory feedback is applied to maximally involve the patient in the virtual world. Furthermore, perception when interacting with objects is mim- icked by sound feedback. As the third modality, haptic feedback has been implemented to support the patient (e.g. haptic table) or to enhance the level of realism by adding friction and weight to objects. To simplify collision detection, only the end-effector posi- tion (representing the hand), is considered for haptic interaction. Virtual objects are rendered as cylinders or cuboids. To calculate the haptic feedback each object is modeled by a spring-damper system. When a collision occurs the calculated force is applied at the endeffector by the controller. While the visual and audi- tory feedback use a sampling rate of 60 Hz, the haptic feedback is rendered with 1 kHz. During the rehabilitation of patients it is important that the training is linked to the real world in order to maximize the transfer to daily life. Realistic behaviour of objects is provided by the physics and collision detection engine of GIANTS. Instead of 3D-vision lighting and shadow effects help to perceive visual depth in the virtual world. Important in reha- bilitation therapy is the adaptability of the virtual world to the skills of the patient. Therefore, the avatar hand can be moved by the therapist to a position, where the patient can reach all objects needed within the range of movement available to him or her.

They are often treated in ves- tibular rehabilitation programmes by exposure to situations that stimulate their symptoms in order to promote habituation. Typically, patients are taken through a gradually changing type of exposure that progressively adds situations and positions pro- voking and increasing their symptoms (e.g. dizziness, motion sickness, loss of balance). Due to habituation, the symptoms get weaker during the course of the treatment. VR technologies can support such training, as large immersive visual fields can be cre- ated and changed rapidly to suit patient needs.",

While it is impos- sible to measure motivation itself while a person is immersed in VR, we can assume that certain psychological states (high engage- ment, appropriately balanced workload) can ensure high motiva- tion. For example, it is desirable to control cognitive workload since research in healthy subjects has shown that motor learning decreases in the presence of distracting cognitive tasks that pre- sent cognitively overchallenging situations [118, 119].

    "text": "Post-traumatic stress disorder Persons with post-traumatic stress disorders (PTSD) show symp- toms of fear, helplessness, insomnia, after having been exposed to an extreme stressor or traumatic event. PTSD is characterized by three distinct types of symptoms: (1) they re-experience the event again and again in their imagination, (2) they try to avoid remind- ers of the event, and (3) they are hyper-aroused for at least 1 month after the traumatic event [148]. VR-graded exposure therapy is employed at the point when exposure therapy would normally be introduced. According to Rothbaum et al. [149], VR-graded exposure therapy has several advantages over conventional expo- sure approaches. First, the technology of VR allows to introduce a shared experience between the therapist and participant that is practically impossible without VR. For example, it is almost impos- sible to bring the clinician to the traumatic scenery that caused the disorder, and share all the PTSD patient\u2019s imagined scenes. Second, VR extends the range of options available to a clinician by allowing the opportunity to expose to situations that are dif\ufb01cult, expensive and/or time-consuming in real life. For instance, using a virtual airplane the therapist can expose the patient to the air- port and spend time on a virtual airplane taking off, \ufb02ying in smooth and turbulent weather, and landing, repeatedly, without leaving the of\ufb01ce, all within the typical therapy hour. Third, in a VR setting, the therapist can titrate the situation, thus, creating the perfect exposure for the patient. For example, the patient can expe- rience a certain situation in an airplane, with all features, except one (e.g. excluding turbulence) until the patient is ready to con-",

In this way, VR provides a rich sensory and evocative therapeutic environment that may be particularly help- ful for patients who are reluctant to recall feared memories, have difficulty to emotionally engage in the traumatic memory, or are not very good at imagining situations [149]. Rizzo et al. [150] devel- oped a VR-graded exposure therapy for veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars and found that out of 20 treatment completers, 16 no longer met PTSD criteria at post-treatment.

Enriched environments, highly functional and task-oriented practice environments were shown to be necessary for motor re-learning and recovery after stroke [15]. Additionally, VR can be utilized to test different methods of motor training, types of feed- back provided, and different practice schedules for comparative effectiveness in improving motor function in patients.

In addition, studies have shown that VR exercises should show func- tionally meaningful reactions to the motor performance of the patient to increase motivation [16]. The same study did not find any differences in engagement between VR exercises that differed in providing explicit task goals, frequent performance feedback or competitive training. The authors argued that this could be due to differing preferences and expectations of participating subjects towards the VR exercises. Other game mechanics that have been proposed to encourage motivation are reward systems, variable content, and intuitive tasks [17, 18].",

This has been shown for both upper- and lower-extremity therapy [171, 172]. The primary cause for this effect can be attributed to the passive guidance the robot pro- vides during training [171]. Such continuous guidance preserves desired movement kinematics, reducing actual movement errors. The absence of errors eventually leads to a reduction of effort and, thus, negatively affects the overall effectiveness of the training [173]. Therefore, VR-based feedback of movement is an important factor for motor learning, since it allows patients to evaluate their movement success as well as detect potential movement errors [3, 94]. Conventional concepts that are mostly being deployed are, for example, verbal feedback and mirrors placed in front of the patients, in order to give visual and/or acoustic feedback [4] .

In a pilot randomized clinical trial with stroke patients, Saposnik et al. [177] used the Wii in conjunction with publicly available sports and cooking virtual reality environments. They found that, compared to recreational training, the group of stroke patients using the Wii showed significant improvement in standard motor function tests [177]. Wii has been a popular off-the-shelf activity-promoting device used in other studies such as in balance rehabilitation in patients with acquired brain injury [178], in complementing traditional rehabilitation [179], in cer- ebral palsy rehabilitation [180], and in movement therapy to pro- mote upper-extremity function post-stroke [181].",

For example, a 3D version of the popular game Tetris\u00ae (http://www.tetris.com/) was used to evaluate flex- ible thinking in deaf and hard of hearing children, and it was found that practising 3D spatial rotations did indeed improve flexible thinking [182]. Tetris has found another use in early PTSD therapy, when the symptoms of the disorder are not full blown. In a pilot study [183], participants underwent simulated post-traumatic stress by watching a film consisting of scenes of injury and death. The experimental group, who played Tetris\u00ae, had a reduced frequency of flashback of the traumatic scenes as com- pared to the control group that did no task [183]. Tetris has also found use in cognitive rehabilitation for increasing reaction time and a positive sense of well-being among elderly persons [184].

    "text": "On the other end of the spectrum are more sophisticated reha- bilitation systems which are required in the case of more severely impaired patients, or in disorders for which simple games do not suffice. An example of a high-end system is an immersive virtual environment, consisting of computers, real-time graphics, visual displays, body tracking sensors, and specialized interface devices that serve to immerse a participant in a computer-generated sim- ulated world that changes in a natural way with head and body motion [187]. The capacity of VR technology to create controlla- ble, multisensory, interactive 3D stimulus environments, within which a person can become immersed and interact, offers clini- cal assessment and intervention options that are not possible using simple games or traditional neuropsychological methods [187]. This is relevant for cases in which the nature of the disor- der under therapy often precludes the use of simple computer games, for example full-fledged PTSD. PTSD is often encountered in veterans who are returning from combat, which is enormously stressful from a physical, emotional, cognitive, and psychological perspective [188]. Therefore, PTSD therapy must reflect that inten- sity [188], which can be achieved with immersive VR, and which is not possible with simple games or traditional neuropsycho- logical methods. Additionally, persons undergoing immersive VR therapy can practise in a controlled environment and can meas- ure their success in real-time through feedback [189]. Numerous researchers have used immersive VR systems for PTSD therapy with positive results [150\u2013153].",

A robot can support the patient\u2019s impaired limb, making therapy less demanding both for the patients and the human therapist [190]. Additionally, robotic devices can also implement novel forms of mechanical manipulation that are impossible for therapists to emulate, which may ultimately enhance movement recovery of patients [190]. Robot-assisted rehabilitation can be extended by adding immersive VR with head-mounted dis- play and haptic feedback so that patients can feel and manipulate objects in a large 3D workspace. Haptic devices can also be used as standalone rehabilitation interfaces, by providing different kinds of adjustable haptic forces like assistance and friction that can be changed in magnitude according to the level of disorder of the patient [191]. Another complex immersive VR environment, which can be used for rehabilitation is a \u2018cave\u2019 consisting of a room whose walls, ceiling and floor surround a viewer with projected images on a virtual reality environment [31].",

Positive effects have been observed also when VR is applied for balance or back training. Additionally, VR technology has been used for the train- ing of cognitive function, for example to increase motivation and engagement, to treat patients with mild cognitive impairments, dementia, TBI, ADHD, or ASD.

Any additional therapeutic effect in these applications is, however, not excluded, but even desired.\n\nAbovementioned studies show that sensory-motor or cogni- tive functions of patients can be improved through the appli- cation of VR technology. A systematic review performed by Henderson et al. [192] provides some evidence that movement training with immersive VR yields functional improvements in the upper extremities of stroke patients. In contrast, Laver et al. [193] published another systematic review, based on the selec- tion of 19 younger studies, where they concluded that the effect of interactive games shows only limited improvements of arm and gait function in stroke patients.

Similarly, Adamovic et al.

Usability of the technology refers to the complexity of the technical components, and includes aspects such as weight and size, donning and doffing time, comfort, adjustability, adaptabil- ity, and immersion. Usability and price of the technology affect, eventually, the acceptance by the wearer and the clinician who is working with the technology.
