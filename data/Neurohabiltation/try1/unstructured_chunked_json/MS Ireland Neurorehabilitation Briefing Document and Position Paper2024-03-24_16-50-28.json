It ranges from intensive treatment in acute hospital settings to long-term community-based rehabilitation. The function of neurorehabilitation is to both prevent unnecessary deterioration in a person\u2019s condition and functioning, and to help compensate for any function that has been lost as a result of a neurological condition.",

A draft implementation plan is currently in the process of being developed by this group.\n\nContent of the report and strategy\n\nCurrent neurorehabilitation services\n\nThe report found that current neurorehabilitation services are provided in a range of different settings, by many organisations including acute medical services, community-based health services, voluntary sector organisations and informal carers. Existing services are critically underdeveloped and often develop on an unplanned basis. Statutory services are focused heavily on medical rehabilitation, which whilst crucial, is not sufficient in isolation. People who require neurorehabilitation have a need for ongoing therapeutic supports as well as acute, specialised hospital care. Some specialised acute services do exist but are limited and there is currently a serious lack of ongoing supports across all settings. The report also noted high levels of \u2018condition-specific\u2019 services; i.e. services limited to supporting individual conditions.",
