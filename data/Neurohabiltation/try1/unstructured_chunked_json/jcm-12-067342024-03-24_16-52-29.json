Stroke recovery therapies are crucial in reducing the long-term disability burden after stroke. Stroke recovery treatment options have rapidly expanded within the last decade, and we are in the dawn of an exciting era of multimodal therapeutic approaches to improve post-stroke recovery. In this narrative review, we highlighted various promising advances in treatment and technologies targeting stroke rehabilitation, including activity-based therapies, non-invasive and minimally invasive brain stimulation techniques, robotics- assisted therapies, brain\u2013computer interfaces, pharmacological treatments, and cognitive therapies. These new therapies are targeted to enhance neural plasticity as well as provide an adequate dose of rehabilitation and improve adherence and participation. Novel activity-based therapies and telereha- bilitation are promising tools to improve accessibility and provide adequate dosing. Multidisciplinary treatment models are crucial for post-stroke neurorehabilitation, and further adjuvant treatments with brain stimulation techniques and pharmacological agents should be considered to maximize the recovery. Among many challenges in the \ufb01eld, the heterogeneity of patients included in the study and the mixed methodologies and results across small-scale studies are the cardinal ones. Biomarker-driven individualized approaches will move the \ufb01eld forward, and so will large-scale clinical trials with a well-targeted patient population.",

The initial spontaneous recovery occurs via this neuroplasticity, mainly by neuroregeneration and reorganization. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies showed reorganization of the lesional area into the non-lesional cortex [1,2]. This reorganization is associated with increased bilateral activation in the early/acute phase, which becomes lateralized towards the non-lesional hemisphere in the chronic phase. The later changes typically lead to a maladaptive interhemispheric imbalance, which may interfere with recovery. These post-stroke intra and interhemispheric changes were",

Vagus Nerve Stimulation\n\nVagus nerve stimulation (VNS) is a minimally invasive neuromodulation technique provided concomitantly with behavioral therapies such as task-oriented arm therapy in stroke to enhance motor recovery. Meyer and colleagues provided an initial proof of concept that, compared to sham stimulation, coupling VNS with rehabilitative training resulted in a twofold increase in long-term recovery for complex and basic motor tasks in rats with stroke [12]. Overall, the proposed mechanism of VNS in post-stroke motor recovery is the reorganization of the primary motor cortex through modulation of cholinergic and noradrenergic retrograde projections of nucleus tractus solitarius (one of the main vagus nuclei).",

This led to a phase III pivotal trial in which Dawson and colleagues performed a random- ized, sham-controlled, blinded, adequately powered study that showed that compared to sham stimulation, patients in the active VNS groups had a signi\ufb01cantly higher likelihood of achieving clinically meaningful motor recovery (measured by at least six points increase in the upper extremity Fugl-Meyer assessment) at 90 days [7]. After the positive results of the pivotal phase III trial, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of VNS in patients with chronic ischemic stroke and moderate to severe arm weakness. The real-world implementation of VNS for post-stroke upper extremity recovery is still underway. A multidisciplinary approach, including vascular neurology, neurosurgery, and rehabilitation medicine, is crucial for success. Additionally, patient compliance and the \ufb01nancial burden for long-term management are other critical factors for real-world implementation. Finally, stroke patients generally have multiple comorbidities potentially requiring antithrombotic use, which might make them ineligible for the procedure. Al- though non-invasive VNS (nVNS) might be an alternative treatment for patients ineligible for VNS therapy, previous studies failed to show consistent neuromodulatory effects of nVNS in the motor cortex [15,16].",

The meta-analyses and evidence-based guidelines suggest that using low-frequency over the contralesional hemisphere and high- frequency rTMS over the ipsilesional hemisphere in the subacute phase is potentially effective. At the same time, very limited evidence exists for the use of rTMS in the chronic phase to enhance upper extremity rehabilitation [21]. However, current evidence from randomized controlled trials is con\ufb02icting.

Based on initial evidence of rTMS effects on reducing contralesional extinction by Oliveri and colleagues, studies focused on excitability-reducing paradigms such as low-frequency rTMS and continuous theta burst stimulation (cTBS) over the contralesional-hemisphere [28,29]. Despite studies suggesting improvement with rTMS over the contralesional hemisphere, the evidence is limited given most of these studies were not controlled. Also, another sham-controlled study compared low-frequency rTMS of the contralesional hemisphere, high-frequency rTMS of the ipsilesional hemisphere, and sham stimulation. It showed better improvement of visuospatial neglect in ipsilesional high-frequency rTMS compared to other groups [30]. cTBS, another inhibitory TMS stimu- lation protocol, has more promising evidence in visuospatial neglect. Five sham-controlled studies with overall similar protocols showed signi\ufb01cant clinical improvement in cTBS over the left posterior parietal cortex, as well as improvement in global functioning [21,31\u201334]. A recent study showed the response to cTBS was associated with the integrity of interhemi- spheric connections within the corpus callosum, indicating that responders had corpus callosum intact but not in non-responders [33]. Currently, Level C evidence supports the use of cTBS of the contralesional hemisphere for visuospatial neglect [21].

The current from the electrode suf\ufb01ciently penetrates the underlying brain tissue by \ufb02owing across the scalp. It provides a sub-threshold stimulus that modulates neuronal transmembrane potentials and, therefore, in\ufb02uences the level of polarization and likelihood of neuronal \ufb01ring [35]. Two modes of tDCS have been most commonly used: anodal stimulation increases excitability and cathodal stimulation decreases the excitability of the cortex.

This study, with a futility design, showed the feasibility and possible clinical improvement in speech production (naming). Most of these studies were conducted on chronic stroke patients; therefore, another recent trial tested the effects of MRI-guided anodal tDCS over the language cortex combined with computer-delivered lan- guage therapy in subacute poststroke aphasia patients (varying types of aphasia included in the study) [11].

Interestingly, in their secondary analysis, the discourse signi\ufb01cantly improved in the tDCS group \ufb01ve weeks after therapy, which is critical to life participation and quality of life.

The main issues with these trials include the heterogeneous study population with mainly mild stroke patients, which might decrease the sensitivity to detect group differences. Another limitation was the use of mRS, which may limit the interpretation of these trials. Despite the fact that mRS is commonly used in studies for stroke outcomes to assess functional independence, this measure is potentially insensitive in capturing various improvements in different systems such as motor, language, cognition, etc. SSRIs may still play an important role in treating post-stroke depression and possibly improve recovery, especially if paired with other therapies. Finally, given language recovery was limitedly assessed in these trials, another multicentered, randomized, placebo-controlled phase II trial (ELISA: Escitalopram and Language Intervention for Subacute Aphasia trial) is currently in the recruitment phase, assessing the effect of escitalopram as an adjunct to traditional speech and language treatment [106].",

Stem cell therapies have been a promising treatment approach for potential neuroprotection and neuroregeneration [110]. Neuro- protective use of stem cells aims to limit the extent of initial damage during the acute stroke phase and expand the window of available treatments. Neuroregenerative stem cell therapies aim to reduce the neuronal loss and to replace injured neurons. Here, we highlight the evidence for the neuroregenerative use of stem cells to enhance post-stroke recovery. The initial evidence is from animal stroke models: one meta-analysis including 141 pre-clinical studies showed improvement in functional outcomes including motor, sensorimotor and cognitive function, without any differences based on delivery route or dose [111]. A phase I/II non-controlled study showed that single-dose intravenous allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells were safe in patients with chronic stroke and substantial functional, and furthermore suggested behavioral gains [112]. A single-center, open-label randomized clinical trial (ISIS-HERMES trial) showed improved motor outcomes after intravenous autologous mesenchymal stem cell combined with rehabilitation [113]. The treatment group had greater motor cortex activation suggesting that this effect was through sensorimotor neuroplasticity. On the other hand, the RECOVERY trial, a phase 2, ran- domized, sham-controlled study, assessed the safety and ef\ufb01cacy of intracarotid infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived ALD-401 and showed no signi\ufb01cant difference in mRS at 90 days [114].

This therapy is brief (20 min), easy to perform, and has advantages for in-hospital/clinic use standardization. PAT is well tolerated; adverse effects include mild and transient discomfort or dizziness [121]. Level A evidence supports using cognitive rehabilitation for spatial neglect, including PAT [122]. A systematic review including 26 controlled studies suggests improvement in functional disability during daily living activities with PAT [123]. However, the results from controlled studies are inconsistent and present variability in patient responses to PAT. One of the issues with the current literature is the failure to stratify spatial neglect patients; as discussed above, PAT may be more effective in \u201caiming\u201d spatial neglect rather than early perceptual de\ufb01cits. Studies demonstrated speci\ufb01c alterations in spatial motor aiming bias in healthy and stroke patients with PAT [124]. Furthermore, the outcome measure choices in the literature are more oriented to spatial attention or awareness, therefore failing to capture the improvements with PAT [121]. The dosage of PAT is also variable in studies, and a recent study predicted greater improvement with a higher dose of PAT [125]. Finally, the neuroanatomy of stroke lesions may affect the response to PAT. A recent randomized controlled study showed that only patients with frontal lesions improved their neglect symptoms, while the presence of frontal lesions did not affect the response in the standard-care group [126].",

While action observation therapy is de\ufb01ned as the perception of other individuals performing a motor task, motor imagery is a mental practice to simulate a movement without motor input [135]. This mental practice theory for neurorehabilitation is based on multiple forms of evidence which indicate that imagery of a motor task induces a similar pattern of brain activity compared to actual motor execution [136]. More recently, the focus of research has been combining motor imagery and action observation, and this combination was found to involve a greater neuronal activity including other supplemental cortical and subcortical motor areas [137]. Therefore, the possible bene\ufb01ts of these treatments have been tested for motor recovery after stroke. Despite motor imagery having promising early studies [138,139], the overall literature is con\ufb02icting [140,141].

These therapies target to enhance neural plasticity and help overcome challenges of rehabilitation access in order to provide an adequate dose of rehabilitation and improve adherence and participation. CIMT and telerehabilitation are promising to overcome these challenges of accessibility and dosing, and the future of recovery is focused on involving virtual reality in activity-based treatments. The mul- tidisciplinary treatment models are crucial for post-stroke neurorehabilitation; further adjuvant treatments with brain stimulation techniques and pharmacological agents should be considered to maximize the recovery. Finally, there is a signi\ufb01cant gap in identifying and treating cognitive disorders after stroke, further diagnostic/screening tools and treatment options are needed. One of the main challenges in the \ufb01eld is the methodological variations and heterogeneous patient populations that limit providing an overarching conclusion. The studies and their mixed results point out the importance of matching the appropriate patient population; therefore, developing biomarkers is crucial to guide future research designs and clinical practices.",
