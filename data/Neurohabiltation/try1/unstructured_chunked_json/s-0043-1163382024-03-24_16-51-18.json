To this group belong anti-convulsive agents such as phenytoin and barbiturates as well as benzodiazepines, butyrophynones and the antihyper- tensives clonidine and prazosine. Whenever possible these drugs should be avoided in the course of brain recovery after a cerebral lesion. For only two substances (the SSRI fluoxetine and cerebrolysin, a mixture of pleotropic neuropeptides and amino acids) large randomized controlled trials showed a positive influence on facilitating motor recovery after the stroke. Both substances probably work through pleotropic multiple molecular mecha- nisms and not as a one-to-one agonist on the receptor. In ge- neral the use of antidepressive agents especially SSRI after the stroke can also be recommended for non-depressed stroke patients. Also dopaminergic drugs have been shown in smaller studies to positively influence functional recovery. Considering their low side-effect profile, the tentative use of 100 mg of L-Dopa per day in the subacute phase of the stroke can be recommen- ded. In MS patients the use of antidepressive agents is also recommend to improve life quality. In patients with diminished states of consciousness amantadi- ne is the only substance which a randomized controlled study proved to have at least some transient effect. The use of aman- tadine can be recommended for the improvement of the level of consciousness in these patients.",

    "text": "Introduction Physicians engaged in neurological rehabilitation constantly have to deal with aspects of primary pharmacological treatment of patients, including control of high blood pressure, anticonvulsive therapies and suitable anticoagulation treatment to reduce risk factors and secon- dary problems. Furthermore, neurological rehabilitation must also take into account pharmacological issues relating to restoration of brain function. This concerns the avoidance of pharmaceuticals that may interfere with brain recovery as well as the use of drugs that may have a positive affect on brain function. This overview aims to provi- de a critical summary of the options available to the clinician in the pharmacological treatment of patients after acute neurological events as part of the process of the rehabilitation of brain organizati- on and restoration of brain function, as well as discuss the avoidance of potentially negative effects of pharmacological interventions.",
