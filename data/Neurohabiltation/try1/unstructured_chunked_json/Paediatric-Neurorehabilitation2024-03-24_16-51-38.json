Population Needs\n\n1.1 National/local context and evidence base\n\nRehabilitation has been defined as a goal-based process which reduces the impact of long-term disabling conditions on daily life. Rehabilitation for neurological conditions is applicable following an acute insult to the central nervous system (CNS) and in progressive or static disability.\n\nIt is recognised that the needs of patients who have sustained an acute injury, whether this is an acquired brain injury (ABI) or acquired spinal injury (ASI), differ from those with less acute conditions because of the need to provide intensive input, usually on an in-patient basis, early in the course of the illness.",
