Whereas modern medical advances have significantly impacted the survival from infectious diseases and improved the longevity from life threatening cardiological and other critical illnesses, the management of neurological problems has not been as successful. There are still many neurological conditions where no drugs were available and where there are no further neurosurgical options. In such cases the only options for the patients to improve the quality of their lives was rehabilitation. But even in rehabilitation of these conditions, things were not so simple. Having to deal with patients who had no movements or limb strength when combined with other aspects such as spasticity, contractures, loss of sensations, cognitive impairment etc made the rehabilitation process very difficult. The work required to rehabilitate these patients was very physically intensive, requiring many hours of laborious work over long periods of time. The results after all this hard work were most often not upto the patients and their relatives satisfaction since what the patients would want is to start walking normally again and this was in most cases just not possible. The subsequent reluctance of patients to pay for the services appropriate to the efforts that were put in became another factor.",

NeuroRehabilitation in its original sense was there becoming a dying science and skill. Another limiting aspect of treating this was the artificial barriers we had put up between the different branches of rehabilitation mainly physiotherapy and occupational therapy. We all tended to look at the patients from our specialty point of view and this often times did not let us see the whole picture. This was in a sense unfortunate since this was one aspect of rehabilitation where a real difference could be made.",

The availability of regenerative medicine using healthy cells (such as Stem cells) to replace damaged cells has opened up a entire new world of treatment options giving fresh hope to millions of patients who had given up on any hope for improvement. What Stem cells do is that they initiate a process of repair, replacement and regeneration of the damaged cells by a process of release of various growth factors, increased blood supply and cellular replacement. This sort of reenergizes the nervous and musculoskeletal system. However this is only part of the improvement process. The real functional changes in the patients lives come from rehabilitation. What the Stem cell therapy does is that it makes the rehabilitation process more effective and productive. Improvements not seen earlier just with rehabilitation are now visible.

A entire group of patients who had given up on rehabilitation since they were not getting encouraging improvements are now coming back to rehabilitation. The newer fancier corporate hospitals that are just about introducing stem cell therapy are now seeing rehabilitation in a new way. This is an incredible opportunity. A field that had been forgotten and given up as not being useful or remunerative enough is now being looked upon with a whole new interest. It's a rebirth or a renaissance of sorts. Much like how the older radio had almost died in the 80's and 90's with the advent of television but had a rebirth in the last decade with the introduction of FM radio.",

    "text": "In this book all the different aspects of rehabilitation (physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech therapy, counseling, clinical and surgical aspects ) have all been put together in individual chapters that are focused on an individual diseases or medical condition. This is intentional and meant to highlight the multidisciplinary approach to NeuroRehabilitation. Various theoretical aspects have been covered along with practical advice and suggestions on management. Extensive literature reviews have been done to incorporate the best of whatever is available from all across the world. Valuable individual information gathered from years of experience have also been incorporated. This is important. To highlight this let me state that at the NeuroGen Brain and spine institute we receive patients regularly from all over the world. These patients have already been to the best rehabilitation centers in the USA and elsewhere. And yet despite this virtually all the patients without any exceptions have one thing to say. \" that they have never received the kind of rehabilitation in all the centers they had been to, which they received at NeuroGen\". What is the difference between what is offered at NeuroGen and what is offered in the bigger rehabilitation centers all over the world. At NeuroGen there is the human touch. There are virtually no fancy electronic machines or equipment. Our rehabilitation makes a difference because its more hands on with the rehabilitation therapist working intensely and closely with the patients instead of depending on machines and watching from a distance.",

The joy of this treatment lies not as much in the money but in the small small functional improvements seen in the patients and their gratefulness and gratitude for the same. There were very few therapists who have dedicated their lives to this work. And these therapists belong to an older generation. It was important that the wisdom and knowledge of their years of experience was passed on to today's younger generation. This is therefore one of the important intentions of this book.",

However very few patients have the technical knowledge regarding the management of their condition. Hence the therapists have to make efforts to explain the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches. Many a times it is beneficial to show other rehabilitated patients who have successfully undergone the rehab process and how they have solved their own problems, thereby living a productive life within their face of limitations. Before taking the final decision it is mandatory on the part of the therapist to consult other team members and each one of them has to make a thorough evaluation of the motor skills, functional skills, home assessment, ADL, etc. Rehab begins from the day of the injury. All the interventions planned for the patient from day one focuses on prevention of further damage to the spinal cord and to preserve the functional capabilities, most vital to save the patient. So a brief review of the SCI is discussed below. In the initial phase after the SCI, surgeon plays a vital role especially to decompress and stabilize the spine so that the actual physical rehabilitation can commence at the earliest. How big is the problem? To put light to the intensity of the SCI issue, the epidemiology is stated below.",

Perhaps, it is the posture control that matters most. Foam cushion has the benefit of being more porous with less moisture formation. However it is essential that the covering should be of light cotton material and not plastic. Another disadvantage of foam cushion is that if the atmospheric temperature is high, the skin temperature also tends to increase. Older patients tend to have lower skin capillary pressures (even as low as 20mm). Thin patients have less fat to cover bony prominences so also, flaccid patients.

This is not an easy thing for a person who was walking and running or driving a vehicle a few days or months back. For him to accept this slow moving mode of mobility is very difficult. Not only that, the stigma attached to the wheelchair is too much. However when he realizes that he is bedridden and that without moving from the bed, life becomes monotonous and a desire could come to him to get into a wheelchair. If he observes another wheelchair bound patient moving around comfortably, he too would consider getting into a wheelchair and attempt moving at least within house. When he observes people even get out of the house in a wheelchair and face other people in the society, slowly he gets a desire to accept a wheelchair for mobility rather than remain in a bedridden condition. This acceptance is the first step towards rehabilitation.",

Muscle contraction can provide much more compressive force also shearing and torsion forces increase bone density significantly.\n\nOne study done by Jacqueline Claus-Walker and several physicians at TIPR in 70\u2019s found that calcium excretion increases during the first ten days, and continues to increase in the next six months and after 1 year it lowers to normal.

The paraplegic with the help of the occupational therapist\n\novercomes difficulties successfully with the use of various aids and adaptive equipment and modifications in the home and place of work environment. A variety of purposeful activities are also used and modified to promote self-esteem by highlighting functional skills and emphasizing the tangible development of a client\u2019s physical, social, emotional, sensory and cognitive abilities. OT\u2019s unique contribution to occupational performance lies in its use of purposeful activities to promote psychological and physical health and maximum functional independence. As a part of complex rehabilitation, it is applied in solving the problems of occupation (self-care, work and leisure) of patients. It is emphasized that early OT, started immediately after stabilization of patient\u2019s functional state, is of great importance.",

An occupation is of varying importance to patients, but most will see it as giving a sense of purpose to their life and will want to return to their former work if at all possible. Early contact with the patient's employer to discuss the feasibility of an eventual return to his previous job is important. If the degree of the patient's disability precludes this some employers are sympathetic and flexible, and will offer a job that will be possible from a wheelchair. If appropriate, a work site assessment may be arranged. An on- site work task analysis performed at the client\u2019s workplace as well as examination of the worker and the work environment will provide the therapist valuable insight about the present skills of the patient.

Patient should be taught glossopharyngeal breathing, also called frog breathing or air stacking. Muscles of the tongue, soft palate, pharynx and larynx work together to create a pumping action that forces gulps of air into the trachea and lungs. Patient traps air in a pocket of negative pressure within their mouths, which allows them to maximize that space, pulling in more air, then closing their lips, and forcing the air back and down the throat with stroking maneuvers of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.

It should be measured before muscle testing to determine available pain\u2013free range. It helps to identify if there are any contractures or potential to develop the same. In cases of spinal instability caution should be used while performing any movement.",

Some incidence has been reported in SCI as low as T10.\n\nThe occurrence of AD increases as the patient evolves out of spinal shock. With the return of sacral reflexes, the possibility of AD increases. AD occurs during labor in approximately two thirds of pregnant women with SCI above the level of T6.\n\nThe male-to-female ratio for sustaining SCI is 4:1; therefore, autonomic dysreflexia is primarily a male phenomenon.",

Patients commonly have a headache caused by vasodilation of pain-sensitive intracranial vessels.\n\nVasomotor brainstem reflexes attempt to lower blood pressure by increasing parasympathetic stimulation to the heart through the vagus nerve to cause compensatory bradycardia. The fact that this reflex action cannot compensate for severe vasoconstriction is explained by the Poiseuille formula, which demonstrates that pressure in a tube is affected to the fourth power by a change in radius (vasoconstriction); the pressure is affected only linearly by a change in flow rate (bradycardia).

HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION\n\nINTRODUCTION:\n\nHeterotopic ossification following spinal cord injury (SCI) was first described by Dejerine and Ceillier in 1918 as para osteoarthropathy. The ossification process involves the formation of mature lamellar bone, which is indistinguishable from normal bone, in soft tissues surrounding paralyzed joints. The bone is not connected to periosteum and becomes encapsulated as it matures.\n\nThe pathology is similar to that of fracture callus, except that bone forms in the connective tissue between the muscle planes (histologic findings in neurogenic heterotopic ossification are similar to those in healing fracture callus). Heterotopic ossification is also seen after other neurologic insults, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI) and",

Bone morphogenic proteins likely act on mesenchymal stem cells present in tissue, activating the cells to differentiate into osteoblasts.\n\nINCIDENCE:\n\nThe incidence of heterotopic ossification in spinal cord injury is between 16% and 53%, depending on the incidence reports from various institutions. Once present, neurogenic heterotopic ossification is clinically significant in 18-27% of cases.

    "text": "PATHOPHYSIOLOGY OF HETEROTOPIC OSSIFICATION\n\nThe mechanism underlying heterotopic ossification following spinal cord injury is not fully understood but it appears to be initiated by mesenchymal cells into bone precursor cells. It has been noted that mesenchymal stem cells can differentiate into osteogenic cells given the right stimuli within the right environment, even soft tissues. These mesenchymal stem cells can generate cartilage, bone, muscles, tendons, ligaments or fat and are thought to play a pivotal role in the development of Heterotopic Ossification. Heterotopic Ossification then forms through a typical process beginning with the formation of a protein mixture created by bone cells (osteoid) that eventually calcifies within a matter of weeks. Over the next few months, the calcified osteoid remodels and matures into well-organized trabecular bone. Months following the initial trauma patients develop bone formation in muscle and soft tissues adjacent to a joint (paraarticular) with resultant restriction in range of motion, pain and ankylosis. The bony lesion has a high metabolic rate, adding new bone at more than three times the rate of normal bone. Osteoclastic (bone removal cell) density is more than twice that found in healthy bone. It is suspected there may be a neurogenic factor contributing to Heterotopic Ossification but the mechanism is poorly understood.",

Since then, the debate between resting the joint and aggressive PROM has continued.

It occurs in parts of the body like the bones, joints, and muscles. Musculoskeletal pain is usually worsened by movement and eased with rest. It can generally be described as a dull or aching pain, but the pain can also be described in other terms.\n\nSecondary overuse (pressure syndromes) is a very common cause of musculoskeletal pain. The pain can occur months or many years after injury. It is caused by the overuse of muscles in any part of the body. For example, many people develop tendonitis of the rotator cuff (shoulder) as a result of pushing a manual wheelchair for a long period of time.",

A: After nerve damage, transcription and axonal trafficking of sodium channels to the site of injury is increased, with concomitant attenuation of potassium channels. The altered expression of ion channels results in neurons becoming hyperexcitable and generating ectopic activity, which is thought to lead to the genesis of spontaneous and paroxysmal pain. B: At the cell body of primary afferent neurons within the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), sympathetic neuronal sprouting occurs and may account for sympathetically maintained pain. C: Peripheral nerve injury causes a multitude of changes in gene transcription and activation of various kinases and proteins, including enhanced N-methyl-D- aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity. However, nerve injury also elicits hypertrophy and activation of glial cells, including microglia within the grey matter of the spinal cord. Microglia expresses P2X4 purinergic receptors, allowing them to be activated by adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Following activation, microglia release various pronociceptive cytokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a) and neurotrophins, including brain-derived neurotrophic factor, which in turn exacerbates nociceptive transmission and contributes",

Neuropathic conditions also cause aberrant symptoms of spontaneous and stimulus-evoked pain. Spontaneous pain (continuous or intermittent) is commonly described as burning, shooting or shock-like. Stimulus-evoked pain includes allodynia (pain evoked by a nonpainful touch) and hyperalgesia (increased pain evoked by a painful stimulus). Allodynia can be caused by the lightest stimulation, such as skin contact with clothing or a light breeze. These sensory abnormalities may extend beyond nerve distributions, which may lead to the inappropriate diagnosis of a functional or psychosomatic disorder.

For some neuropathic pain syndromes, available treatments are tolerable and afford meaningful relief to a considerable proportion of patients. Nevertheless, many patients report intractable and severe pain, and better treatment strategies are desperately needed. The field of neuropathic pain research and treatment is in the early stages of development, with many goals yet to be achieved. In particular, future laboratory, clinical and epidemiologic research into pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of neuropathic pain is expected as well as improved dissemination of new information to health professionals and the public. Over the years to come, many upcoming advances are expected in the basic and clinical science of neuropathic pain as well as in the implementation of improved therapies for patients who continue to experience these devastating conditions.",

This is possible because the spinal cord has certain normal automatic functions, which are under the influence of the brain. These functions include muscle tone and reflexes. Most spinal cord injured persons have a healthy, intact spinal cord below the immediate area of their injury, and thus these automatic activities can continue to exist. However, they are no longer under the regulating influence of the brain and are thus exaggerated. This is called spasticity.",

Following the period of spinal shock changes occur in the nerve cells that control muscle activity. Spasticity is an exaggeration of the normal reflexes that occur when the body is stimulated in certain ways.

Many people know when a urinary tract infection is coming on by the increase in muscle spasms. Spasticity also helps to maintain muscle size and bone strength. It does not replace walking, but it does help to some degree in preventing osteoporosis. Spasticity helps maintain circulation in the legs and can be used to improve certain functional activities such as performing transfers or walking with braces. For these reasons, treatment is usually started only when spasticity interferes with sleep or limits an individual's functional capacity",

There are three primary medications used to treat spasticity, baclofen, Valium, and Dantrium. All have some side effects and do not completely eliminate spasticity. Other interventions to help reduce or control spasms include injections of Botulinum Toxin A (Botox) or phenol directly into the muscles of concern. Injection therapy usually lasts 3-4 months. Surgical interventions include the insertion of an Intrathecal Baclofen Pump. A Baclofen pump trial is conducted first to make sure there is an adequate response to the intrathecal baclofen. Once it is determined that a person responds to the intrathecal baclofen therapy, surgery is scheduled. The pump must be refilled every three months but is dependent upon the amount of drug needed by each person.In the case of SCI, the distribution of spasticity tends to be more diffuse, making regional or systemic treatment preferable.34 The decision whether or not to treat spasticity and, if so, in what manner, is summarized nicely in a flow chart",

In general incidence of infective complications is higher with an indwelling urethral catheter than with a supra pubic catheter.

Emotional responses dealt with by psychotherapy include a range of ego defences, most commonly repression and denial. Typically, as denial decreases over time, depression, anxiety, and anger increase. How these emotions are expressed depends largely on the patient's premorbid personality style. Psychotherapy can help via reinforcing adaptive coping skills and teaching new coping strategies. The psychologist may also work with the interdisciplinary team to develop behavioural modification programs, based on learning theory, to decrease these behaviours. Contingency management and behavioural \"contracting\" are, most frequently used in rehabilitation settings [4]. Approaches emphasizing positive reinforcement to \"shape\" desired behaviours are particularly effective.

The term 'stroke' is synonymous with cerebrovascular accident (CVA) and is purely clinical definition which, according to the World Health Organisation, can be defined as a 'rapidly developed clinical sign of a focal disturbance of cerebral function of presumed vascular origin and of more than 24 hours duration' Included within this definition are most cases of cerebral infarction, cerebral haemorrhage and subarachnoid haemmorhage, but deliberately excluded are those cases in which recovery occurs within 24 hours. These are designated as 'transient ischaemic attacks' (TIA). The vascular lesion could be either hemmorhagic or thromboembolic phenomena (leading to ischaemia) involving the blood vessels supplying various parts of the brain. The extent of neurological involvement may range from mild motor deficit to gross involvement of various function, namely Sensorimotor, perceptual, emotional, behavioural, memory intelligence, speech & language function.",

Also, lack of oxygen is another factor that could contribute to swelling. This vascular lesion to the brain causes release of neurotransmitters like glutamate & aspartate by the ischemic cells, which excites neurons & produces an intracellular influx of Na & Ca leading to irreversible cell damage.

However this is a good position to allow pectoral muscles to be stretched. Pillows should be used to prevent affected shoulder and hip falling into retraction.",

A firm, supportive surface will provide proprioceptive feedback, enable rolling and promote independence when sitting up. However, pressure areas also need to be monitored. Where hospital pressure care mattresses are used, the patient is likely to require more assistance to turn and sit up.\n\nEncouraging the patient to sit up through side lying promotes head righting, weight transference and a sense of midline. More independence is offered to the early stroke patient in supported sitting and they gain a more normal visual perspective of their environment. There is scope for the unaffected arm to be used in a range of functional activities. The trunk muscles begin to be used actively and the lower limbs begin to form a stable base of support. It is important to note that sitting is not a passive task; the early patient may develop inappropriate muscle activity and 'holding' postures if they do not receive sufficient support from the chair or pillows. Those with sensory loss will require pressure areas to be monitored. Where head control is still lacking, support must be provided.",

Early cognitive therapy will focus on increasing alertness and attention. It will also focus on improving the stroke victim's orientation to person, place, time and situation. It will also help the stroke victim to comprehend speech, another problem associated after a stroke attack.

All of a sudden the old rules don't work anymore, and new ones need to be drawn out. This can be an extremely frustrating time, particularly for the care recipient and their caregivers. You can minimize these frustrations by drawing up a care plan [115].\n\nEvery family tends to have 'tried and true' ways of making decisions. Family members may also have 'roles' that give them certain duties and responsibilities. If a family member becomes disabled, one person may immediately assume the role of primary caregiver, whether the arrangement is implicit or explicit. Because the responsibility of a primary caregiver is so great, and so important, it is best to sit down as a group and openly discuss the care of your loved one. Rather than anticipating help from people, who may or may not be aware of what is expected of them, having everyone come together and talk about what needs to be done can help prevent family conflicts. Family members can also use this time to talk about their own feelings.",

A back-up plan in the case of respite care, changing needs or an emergency should also be discussed. And be flexible. If the initial plan doesn't work out, hold another meeting and try to sort out the problems. Some decisions won't be easy, but working together as a family is the best solution.",

The damage to the child's brain affects the motor system, and as a result the child has poor coordination, poor balance, or abnormal movement patterns-or a combination of these characteristics. The universally recognized definition of cerebral palsy is \"a non progressive but not unchanging disorder of movement and / or posture due to an insult to or anomaly of the developing nervous system\". CP is a static disorder of the brain, not a progressive disorder. This means that the disorder or the disease process will not get worse as the time goes on. However the child may appear to worsen if not given proper intervention, not because of an increase in the lesion but just because the damaged brain is not able to cope up with the physical demand of the growing body and the increasing demand of the environment surrounding the child.",

Around the same time, a Freud Neuropathologist in Austria, conducted extensive research and published some of the earliest papers on the subject. But William John Little (1810- 1894),an English surgeon was responsible for the first clinical description, and the recognition of the link between low birth weight and perinatal events in 1843.Dr. Little theorized that lack of oxygen damaged the sensitive brain tissues, which controls movement. Sigmund Freud disputed Dr. Little's conclusions. He pointed out that most CP children suffer from additional problems like seizures, mental retardation and visual disturbances. This led him to believe that CP might be caused during the brain's development in the womb many months before birth. However doctors only seriously began investigating CP in 1861 when Dr. William John Little,published a paper describing children with spastic diplegia. Spastic diplegia is still sometimes called Little's Disease.",

The\n\nenthusiasm for surgical intervention to correct deformities, to provide stability and to improve motor control decreased as assessment showed that deformities recurred or new ones developed. In 1932,Winthrop M.Phelps began developing a new approach. Phelps became aware of the necessity for including exercise, muscle training, and bracing in the treatment of CP. Since Phelp's era various non surgical approaches have evolved, emphasing Neuromuscular training.They include Neuro Muscular Reflex therapy (Fay & Doman), Neurodevelopmental treatment ( Bobath), Neurophysiological Approach (Rood), Proprioreceptive Neuro Muscular Facilitation (Kabat, knott & Voss) and Sensory Integration.",

    "text": "Prevalence & Incidence: Prevalence rates for CP vary somewhat in different countries and regions, largely reflecting economic and nutritional factors and access to good obstetric care. Because of the absence of any \"test \" for CP, the vagueness and elasticity of even the best definition, inaccurate ascertainment (many cases are never reported to physicians or public health authorities) and lack of agreement between different experts in the inclusion of the individual cases, precise figures are difficult to obtain. Further confusion results because many cases die in infancy and others may be so mild as to be unrecognized. Prevalence rate for CP therefore should be presented as the prevalence at a given age per 1000 live births of the defined population under study. Of every 2000 infants born, 5 are born with CP. This incidence had remained constant for over 30 years. Although improvement in medical care have decreased the incidence of CP among some children who otherwise would have developed the disorder. Medical advances have also resulted in the survival of children who previously would have died at a young age, and many of these young children survive with an impairment or a disability such as CP. Throughout the industrialized world a prevalence of about 2 per 1000 is found. In contrast estimates for India are around 45 per 1000, rather more in rural & less in urban populations.5 to 8 percent of premature infants under 1500 grams birth weight, who survive have CP. The marked difference in prevalence provides a challenge for Indian Preventive medicine to make the best",

The degree of rigidity may, from time to time be referred to as \"lead pipe \", \"cog wheel \" or \"intermittent \" rigidity.

Secondary to the brain lesion, there are also mechanical changes in the muscles of children with CP.the muscles produce more force for a given change in length and therefore feel stiff and resist passive lengthening.",

Motor milestones can be best achieved by good postural reactions. Postural reaction consists of righting reactions, protective extension and equilibrium reactions. Initially children first develop righting reactions. Righting reaction allow the child to orient his head in space so that the eyes and mouth are horizontal regardless of the position of the body. It also helps in maintaining the proper alignment of the head with respect to the body and vice versa. Once righting reaction develop in a particular position protective extension comes up. Lastly equilibrium reaction emerge which helps the patient to counteract the opposing force and enable them to maintain balance. These reactions are best developed by various exercises on vestibular ball and tilt board.",

SI uses all senses but focuses primarily on the Vestibular, Proprioceptive and Tactile Senses together known as the power senses. A child's brain organizes sensory stimulation from touch and movement in order to learn and respond successfully to the environment. Vestibular stimulation includes linear, circular and rotatory movements like lying on the top of a large exercise ball while receiving rocking or bouncing movements and sitting inside an inner tube swing. Proprioceptive stimulation includes compression and traction like weight bearing activities like wheel barrow walking and jumping on trampoline and hanging from a trapeze. Tactile stimulation includes different textures stimulation like sand playing, brushing painting activities. Different types of stimuli influence a child's muscle tone and normalizing muscle tone enables a child to move and function well. Children with increased muscle tone typically benefit from calming sensory stimuli such as slow movement, rhythmic music, dim lights and a quiet environment. Children with low muscle tone typically benefit from erratic music, bright lights and irregular movement such as jumping.",

Increased Performance in all ADLs is very important which is specifically addressed by OT. Also, parental education and counseling along with home programs given by therapists help to address the needs of the family as a whole.\n\nPsychological Intervention:\n\nIntroduction:\n\nCerebral palsy causes a lack of muscle control and motor coordination. Children with cerebral palsy are at an increased risk of developing emotional and behaviour problems. They may develop a feeling of learned helplessness and may feel socially isolated. Preschoolers with cerebral palsy are unable to explore the world around them and spend more time passively unengaged as compared to other preschoolers. By school age, social contact is reduced with the majority of free-playing time to non-play or other activities. As these children move on to adolescence, they emphasise on activities planned by adults than on spontaneous activities with peers. As, adults involvement is strictly limited. A lack of participation can lead to the development of physical, medical, cognitive,",

Alternative tests such as Pictorial Teat of Intelligence, the Columbia Mental Maturity Scale or the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test are recommended.

The family members may also be in denial post trauma and they may have an unshakable belief in the injured person's potential for future recovery, underestimating changes and thinking of the person's potential recover, underestimating changes and thinking for the person they remember for before the injury, when they are often faced with different people. Denial should be taken care of when it prevents realistic planning for the future and it may serve as an adaptive function when it maintains family stability and role functions. Family members also undergo depression post the injury and there could be marital problems also, as the spouse may feel he or she is with a completely different person altogether who has aggressive or childish inappropriate behaviour. Divorce may often follow marital difficulties associated with traumatic brain injury.

Kanner suspected that the syndrome was more frequent than it seemed and suggested that some children with the disorder had been misclassified as mentally retarded or schizophrenic. Before 1980, children with pervasive developmental disorder were generally diagnosed with childhood schizophrenia. Over time, it became evident that autistic disorder and schizophrenia are two distinct psychiatric entities. [1 ]",

The concordance rate of autistic disorder in the two largest twin studies was 36 percent in monozygotic pairs versus 0 percent in dizygotic pairs in one study and about 96 percent in monozygotic pairs versus about 27 percent in dizygotic pairs in the second study.

When autistic children have reached school age, their withdrawal may have diminished and may be less obvious, particularly in higher- functioning children. A prominent deficit is seen in ability to play with peers and to make friends; their social behavior is awkward and may be inappropriate. Cognitively, children with autistic disorder are more skilled in visual- spatial tasks requiring skill in verbal reasoning. The cognitive style of children with autism is that they cannot infer the feelings or mental state of others around them. That is, they cannot make attributions about the motivation or intentions of others and thus, cannot develop empathy. This lack of a \"theory of mind\" leaves them unable to interpret the social behaviour of other s and leads to lack of social reciprocation.",

A strict going to sleep routine is even more important for these children than for others, and here their strong need for routine and ritual may be used to help them. Stimulating foods and drinks should be avoided. With the exception of melatonin no drugs are recommended for insomnia in children, unless a simple antihistamine such as Benadryl is given for a few nights to give the parents a break from incessant crying or hyperactivity. Some truly hyperactive children diagnosed with autism and ADHD may be helped to sleep by methylphenidate (Ritalin) but most will be kept awake even longer. Placing bricks under the head of the bed may help keep stomach acid from rising and provide better sleep. Melatonin has been very useful in helping many autistic individuals fall asleep. Other popular interventions include using 5-HTP and implementing a behaviour modification program designed to induce sleep. Vigorous exercise will help a child sleep, and other sleep aids are a weighted blanket or tight fitting mummy-type sleeping bag.",

In some cases, it reportedly encouraged socially acceptable behaviours. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Risperdal as autism medication to treat irritability in autistic children and adolescents. This is the first time the FDA approved a drug to treat behavior-related problems associated with autism in children. The drug can be used to treat aggression, deliberate self-injury and temper tantrums. Risperdal is considered an atypical antipsychotic drug manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. in Beerse, Belgium. For autism, lower dosages ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg per day are used in clinical practice. Extra pyramidal effects and akathisia have been reported adverse effects, as well as sedation, dizziness and weight gain. Drooling was reported more in the risperidone group compared with the placebo group. In this sample, extrapyramidal symptoms were not reported more commonly in the risperidone group.

The items are grouped into three subscales: Stereotyped Behaviors, Communication and Social Interaction. Using objective, frequency-based ratings, the entire scale can be completed and scored in 5 to 10 minutes. A structured interview form is included for gathering diagnostically important information from the child's parents. [13]",

Behavioural interventions involve the therapist controlling the activity and/or consequences to shape the child's responses.\n\nDiscrete Trial Teaching (DTT):\n\nThis is an ABA based therapy which was developed in the 1970's by psychologists Ivar Lovaas, and Robert Koegel, at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA). This principle makes use of the idea that when children with autism are rewarded for desired behaviors, they are likely to repeat that behaviour. For example: the therapist gives the child a motivating cue, such as a request to stand still or maintain eye contact, along with a correct response. The therapist then rewards the child by a praise, toys or food to reward the child for completing the task.",

Each trial consists of a prior, a \"directive\" or request for the individual to perform an action; a behaviour, or \"response\" from the person; and a consequence, a \"reaction\" from the therapist based upon the response of the person. Positive reinforcers are selected by evaluating the individual's preferences.\n\nMany children initially respond to, recognizable or concrete reinforcers such as food items. These concrete rewards are faded as fast as possible and replaced with rewards such as praise and hugs. Early intensive behavioural intervention such as the Lovaas program is usually implemented when the person is young, before the age of six. Parent training is a necessary part of an effective ABA- based program. A maintenance schedule allows for periodic checking so the person does not regress in mastered skills. Discrete trial training is a technique that can be an important element of a comprehensive educational program for the individual with autism spectrum disorder. In some cases, a much less intensive, informal approach of discrete trial training may be provided by a knowledgeable professional to teach specific skills such as sitting and attending.",

Sensory Motor Integration\n\nSensory processing is the normal neurological function that all people experience when their brain information from the processes sensory environment around them. Most of us unconsciously learn to combine our senses (sight, sound, smell, touch, taste, balance, body in space) in order to make sense of our environment. Children with autism face difficulty while doing this.\n\nSensory integration therapy is a type of occupational therapy (OT) that places a child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the senses. During the session, the therapist works closely with the child to encourage movement within the room.",

General Skill Building\n\nOccupational therapists work with children with autism and their families to provide intervention that improves the child's ability to participate in activities of daily living, play and school. In occupational therapy, the focus is on task analysis, breaking down a task into manageable steps for the child, teaching those steps to the key people in the child's environment and structuring task and/or environment to support successful completion. For example, if a child with autism is having difficulty dressing himself, the occupational therapist could use a backward chaining behavioural approach which teaches skills by breaking the tasks down into manageable steps which are always performed in the exact same order (CanChild, 2006). Occupational therapists work as collaborative consultants, providing strategies for intervention to families, teachers, in order to develop a child's skills within their natural environments.",

In some cases, people with autism are literally non- verbal: unable to use speech to communicate at all. In other cases, people with autism have a hard time processing language and turning it into smooth, easy conversation. People with autism may also have a tough time reading faces and body language.

As a result, people on the autism spectrum may not be exposed to opportunities to use artistic media -- or the opportunities may be too challenging in other ways (in large class settings, for example). Art therapy offers an opportunity for therapists to work one- on-one with individuals on the autism spectrum to build a wide range of skills in a manner which may be more comfortable (and thus more effective) than spoken language.

Using unconditional positive regard, the child is accepted at their current level of functioning along with the assumption that they have an intrinsic drive towards improved functioning. This allows children who have autism to be able to work at a pace and focus on change that is fitting to them, increasing self-efficacy and autonomy. In autism research it has been strongly advocated that the therapeutic interventions need to be attuned to the individual child's developmental level. Play therapy automatically operates at the child's current level and is highly individualized, as the children determine the pace and focus of change (Josefi & Ryan, 2004).",

This is a disease which has a significant global impairment of intellect, manifested as difficulty with memory, attention, thinking and comprehension. Other psychological functions can be included including mood, personality, judgment, and social behaviour. There are specific diagnostic criteria that are found for various dementias, such as Alzheimer's disease or vascular dementia, however all dementias have certain common elements that result in significant impairment in social or occupational functioning and cause a significant decline from a previous level of functioning.[1]",

Alzheimer's is actually a disease and is not considered a part of the normal aging process. Most people do not develop any type of dementia. And most people remain cognizant throughout their lifetimes. Indeed, people learn at the age of eighty at the same rate they learned at the age of twenty. Dementia is truly not a part of normal aging.\n\nDEFINITION OF DEMENTIA:\n\nThe World Health Organization (2007): \"a syndrome due to disease of the brain, usually of a chronic or progressive nature, in which there is disturbance of multiple higher cortical functions, including memory, thinking, orientation, comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgment. However, consciousness is not clouded. The impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behavior, or motivation which occurs usually in Alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular disease, and in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain.\"",

The clinically defined syndrome, Alzheimer's dementia has been considered as the paradigm of a cortical dementia syndrome.

Nonetheless, remote memory is also abnormal, and there is a gradient effect regarding recall over a retrograde time interval: The oldest memories appear to be the best preserved, with proportionately greater forgetting as the retrograde interval shortens [3]. In contrast procedural memory appears to be relatively spared. Alzheimer's patients are able to learn simple skills as easily as normal controls and better than patients with subcortical patterns of dementia or patients with various types of sensorimotor deficits [4]. One very important skill that needs to be addressed clinically is driving. Despite the relative preservation of procedural memory, patients with mild Alzheimer's dementia have a higher rate of collisions and moving violations than age-matched controls, although estimates of risk vary, especially during the first 2 years of the disease. Whether this actually results from impaired procedural memory, attentional factors, other cognitive aspects or a combination is unclear, although visual tracking, memory, and Mini-Mental State score all correlate with a laboratory-based driving score.",

However, if no other disease process supervenes, death usually ensues approximately 6 t 10 years after the onset.\n\nVASCULAR DEMENTIA:\n\nThe primary cause of vascular dementia is from impaired blood flow to the brain. Formerly referred to as multi- infarct dementia is presumed to be multiple areas of cerebral vascular disease, resulting in a symptom pattern of dementia. However, the name was changed to vascular dementia to reflect the array of conditions that can impair the blood's ability to circulate to the brain. Vascular dementia often occurs alongside Alzheimer's disease, resulting in mixed dementia between 1% to 4% of people over the age of 65 years have vascular dementia, and the risk of developing it increases dramatically with age. Vascular Dementia most commonly is seen in men especially those with preexisting hypertension or other cardiovascular risk factors.",

Vascular dementia often results from several small strokes that occur over time. It can also occur after a single major stroke, which is sometimes referred to as post-stroke dementia. Not all strokes lead to dementia, but up to one-third of those who have a stroke will develop dementia within six months.

Lewy body dementias can be difficult to diagnose because they can resemble and overlap with other causes of dementia like Alzheimer's disease, other parkinsonian syndromes and vascular dementia.",

In contrast, when the dementia develops prior to or at the same time as the motor disorder, we call the disease DLB. Although the initial sequence of symptoms differs in PDD and DLB, as the disorders progress, the symptoms and the underlying brain changes are much more similar than they are different. As such, many researchers and clinicians think of PDD and DLB as being on a continuum of a similar disease process rather than as two distinct entities.",

Huntington's disease causes memory loss but it appears to be less severe as compared with that of Alzheimer's disease at a matched stage of severity, although this factor has been more consistent at milder stages of dementias. Most studies have found that patients with HD have greater difficulty learning a task, but benefit more by cued recall or recognition as compared with free or unassisted recall. This has been thought to reflect greater impairment of retrieval than storage mechanisms and it affects remote memory retrieval as well as more recently learned material. There are many similarities in memory disturbances between HD and PD, suggesting similarities between subcortial dementia illnesses but overlap is imperfect. Evidence shows that the basal ganglias in patients with Huntington 's disease show a decrease in activity of the mitochondrial pathway, complex II- III. Such deficiencies are often associated with basal ganglia degeneration [9]. This degeneration of striatal neurons projecting to GPe leads to disinhibition of the indirect pathway, increased inhibition of STN, and therefore, reduced output of the basal ganglia [10].",

Although the discrete, stepwise deterioration may not be apparent in all cases, focal neurological symptoms are more common in vascular dementia of the Alzheimer's type, as are the standard risk factors for cerebrovascular disease.\n\nVascular Dementia versus Transient Ischemic Attacks:\n\nTransient Ischemic Attacks (TIA's) are brief episodes of focal neurological dysfunction lasting less than 24 hours.

Reality orientation aims to help patients with dementia by directly focusing on some of the deficits of the disorder, including disorientation and impaired short-term memory. It also helps to preserve skills. The approach can be divided into brief sessions (classroom reality orientation) and a pervasive approach influencing staff-patient interactions throughout the day (24-hour reality orientation). Underlying both of these types of approach is the principle that staff enhances orientation by using identifying names and other information. This is supported by cues such as the commonly used reality orientation board, showing the date, weather, etc. (providing it is kept up to date!) and cues to everyday behaviour such as making tea or visiting a pub. Activities within formal reality orientation sessions include prompting basic information such as the names of group members; looking at current events; and using tactile, olfactory and other stimuli to encourage active cognition.",

There is little evidence to suggest that generalisation occurs (i.e. encouraging orientation for time does not lead to gains in orientation for place). There are also doubts about the suitability of reality orientation for use by informal carers at home.\n\nPerhaps the biggest impact of reality orientation has been on staff attitudes, where it has resulted in staff improving the environments in which they work.

Similarly, older people are not always reminiscing. Some avoid doing so because it is painful, others because they prefer the present. Nevertheless for many older people looking back is an important part of making sense of themselves and their lives. It allows the kind of integration that Erikson (1959) suggests is important as a developmental task of later life. The ability to reminisce is preserved in early dementia. People with dementia are better at remembering what happened many years ago than what happened this week or earlier this morning. The act of reminiscence therefore offers a good way of engaging people with mild to moderate cognitive impairment without reminding them of their cognitive shortcomings. It is quite possible to use reality orientation and reminiscence in combination. Starting with reality orientation before progressing to reminiscence appears to offer better results (Baines et al, 1987) [32]. Whether the activity of reminiscence, per se, can be considered a 'therapy' is open to question. Certainly reminiscence can have powerful emotional consequences and may be used with specific therapeutic targets in mind. However, it is neither a panacea nor is it always appropriate for older people. The overlap between reminiscence and post-traumatic stress disorder requires more careful study. Certainly there are older people whose problem is not how to remember but rather how to forget memories from wartime or other past trauma. The effects of reminiscence, like reality orientation, are dependent on the environment. There is a more obvious effect in a less interactive",

A common example given is of a disoriented person who wants to go home to his or her spouse, not remembering that they have died. Is reorientation the best solution in this situation? Validation therapy focuses on the phenomenology of dementia at an emotional, rather than a factual level. It views the disoriented person as struggling to cope with a complex and confusing world. It is hypothesised that the content of 'confused' talk reflects the emotional meaning of past events.

Older people with mild memory problems can make use of simple aids such as lists, alarms and placing notices and instructions in key areas.

However, consciousness is not clouded. The impairments of cognitive function are commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control, social behavior, or motivation which occurs usually in Alzheimer's disease, in cerebrovascular disease, and in other conditions primarily or secondarily affecting the brain.\" (World Health Organization,2007). Dementia is not a specific disease, but rather symptoms caused by other illness or conditions that affect the brain. Contrary to what many people believe, it is not a normal part of the aging process. It is a severe loss of cognitive ability, such as thinking, memory, and reasoning, that interferes with a person's daily functioning. Symptoms include personality changes, behavioral problems, and memory problems.",

Balance can be defined as postural adaptation to changes in gravitational center with the contribution of normal postural tone. Muscular coordination on the other hand, is the functioning of all muscles active during the voluntary motor movement in appropriate rhythm, velocity and amplitude.

(DeSouza 1990) This results in postural instability leading to imbalance and walking disturbances. It has three subcategories, which are sensory, cerebellar and vestibular ataxia. Some researchers has given frontal ataxia as the 4th category whereas 5th category termed as mixed ataxia which involves symptoms of at least two basic types of ataxia together have been put forward.. In some cases incoordination is usually accompanied by balance dysfunction and gait problems whereas in other cases, balance dysfunction is observed without the existence of in-coordination of movements which includes muscle weakness. For example, if normal walking is considered to be the perfectly timed sequence of muscle activity that occurs in response",

Postural control within the normal functioning of the nervous system is maintained by the different sensory-motor subsystems working together within a circular network. The vestibular, visual, somatosensory systems and cerebellum work in a coordinated manner to produce postural orientation depending upon the goal of the movement and environmental conditions. Each subsystem may be dominant at different times. For example, whenever the type or quality of the surface on which the patient is standing changes, the changes will be registered by the somatosensory system whereas when the information in the visual area changes, the visual system will register changes. The subsystems collecting the information at that particular moment will dominate thereby determining the appropriate motor response (Crutchfield et al. 1989).",

The contribution of proprioceptive senses (position and kinesthesia) is particularly important in the formation of normal motor function (Sherrington 1907, Bear et al. 2001).\n\nPosition and kinesthetic senses are transmitted via fibres with thick myelin which convey messages rapidly and are transmitted to central nervous system through two paths. The first one is the dorsal column- medial lemniscal system through which conscious sensations are conveyed to sensory areas 3,1,2 of cerebral cortex (Bear et al. 2001).

The contents of the treatment program can vary depending on the type and characteristics of ataxia. For instance, while approaches which improve proprioception and incorporate visual aids are used more commonly in patients with sensory ataxia, stabilization training is more important to reduce truncal and extremity ataxia in patients with cerebellar ataxia. The patient with vestibular ataxia should be given habitation exercises in order to reduce vertigo, and also vestibulo-ocular, vestibulo-spinal reflexes should be stimulated to improve balance. In some cases, a problematic condition which requires the use of a number of approaches, such as mixed ataxia, may arise. In such cases, Physiotherapy helps in improving the gait, balance and trunk control of people with ataxia and reduce activity limitations and increase participation.(10)",

Lifestyle counseling is important to help recognize potentially dangerous situations and reduce the likelihood of falls. For example, high risk activities likely to result in falls include turning, sit to stand transfers, reaching and bending over. Patients should also be discouraged from early hazardous activities such as climbing on step stools, ladders, and chairs, or walking on slippery surfaces. The education plan should stress the harmful effects of a sedentary lifestyle. Patients should be encouraged to maintain an active lifestyle, including a program of regular exercise and walking. Medications should be reviewed and those medications linked to increase risk of falls (e.g., medications that result in postural hypotension) should be addressed.",

The approach to the treatment is multipronged and this includes antidepressants, support and environmental changes.

After 1 or 2 months of no response to one antidepressant at a typical dose it is reasonable to switch to another agent. Helpful environmental interventions often involve establishing a structure for the patient, including setting regular hours for sleeping, eating, exercising and getting out of the home. Meanwhile, the patient can be freed from burdensome responsibilities, which then can be gradually reinstated as the patient improves. As always, treatment must be individualized. Unlike depression, the goal for management of personality change or impaired cognition is not elimination of the condition, but rather adaptation to it. Medicines, typically antipsychotics drugs (such as haloperidol, resperidone, or olanzapine) or mood stabilizers (such as valproate or gabapentin) may prove useful in minimizing moodiness or irritability. Apathy may improve with stimulants (such as amphetamines) or other agents affect the chemistry of the dopamine system (such as amantadine). Establishing routines that emphasize the strengths of the affected individual often prove very helpful in managing personality change and cognitive impairment. For instance, a set schedule of regular daily activities, minimizing change from day-to- day, is often helpful for patients who react with anger, suspicion, or confusion to change. New routines with increased stimulation may be of some value in overcoming apathy.",

Asia, Africa and South America are low frequency areas, with incidence reported of less than 5 per 100,000. Perhaps the most incriminating evidence for the role of environmental factors in the development of MS is the changing risk with migration and the occurrence of MS clusters and epidemics. Immigrant populations tend to acquire the MS risk inherent to their new place of residence. Migration from high to low prevalence before the age of 15 lowers the risk, whereas migration after this age does not affect risk. Migration from high to low prevalence areas increases the risk of MS, but the effect of age is less clear. Other environmental factors associated with the development of MS include cigarette smoking (odds ratio of 1.81), animal fat intake, and deficiency of vitamin D. It has been observed that, place where person spends the first 15 years of life may determine to a greater or lesser likelihood of developing MS as opposed to where he or she lives at the time of diagnosis.(3) Minor respiratory infections relapses 27% of relapses in patients with established MS.(4) A multitude of other environmental factors have been suspected to alter the risk for MS (cold climate, precipitation, amount of peat in the soil, exposure to dogs, and consumption of meat, and dairy products), but none has been verified to be an independent risk factor.",

Hot weather, an over-heated room and exercise can all make MS symptoms worse. This is a temporary effect but when the body cools down again, symptoms return to the level they were before. If patients are sensitive to heat, keeping cool during or shortly before exercise may help to do exercise for longer, or more strenuously, without bringing on heat-related symptoms. Patient can take ice drinks, cooling garments, or give regular breaks to prevent overheating. Research showing benefits for these cooling techniques is not conclusive, and they may not help everyone, but they are unlikely to be harmful. Sometimes lowering the body's temperature, with cold baths or cooling garments, cold packs reduce muscle stiffness temporarily. In contrast, some people with MS find that cool temperatures make their spasms or stiffness worse. For these people, exercising in a warm swimming pool may help with stretching and relaxing muscles. Precaution is needed while taking hot and cold therapies. When applying cold directly to the skin, or when using cooling garments or cold water to cool the body, care should be taken not to damage the skin.

Especially, there could be difficulty in finding words i.e. accidentally saying the wrong word and problems with naming i.e. problems with recalling uncommon words or the names of acquaintances. Patients with multiple sclerosis can also have problems with dysphagia or dysarthria, which refer to problems coordinating the movements of the lips, mouth, tongue, and throat. They also suffer from slurred speech or physical difficulty saying certain words or syllables, without any cognitive problems at all.",

Usually patients with multiple sclerosis do not take these changes quiet seriously. Adequate assessments of cognitive deficits need to be carried out by a psychologist or a neuropsychologist with the help of standardized neuropsychological tests. It is also important to evaluate depression, stress, anxiety which may be a contributing factor to cognitive problems with the help of scales like Beck's Depression Inventory, Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, etc. An overall assessment would help the psychologist formulate a good rehabilitation plan like vocational rehabilitation, improved family life, cognitive rehabilitation, etc.",

However, there is a class of drugs called potassium channel blockers (4-aminopyridine (4-AP and 3, 4 diaminopyridine) have been studied for several years. The potassium channel blockers increase the speed of nerve conduction in demyelinated nerve fibers, suggesting that they might improve neurologic function and cognition. However, these drugs lead to high risk for seizures as they speed up the nerve conduction. A recent study of 69 patients suffering from multiple sclerosis with memory deficits showed that Aricept had modest benefits for verbal memory i.e. the ability to remember a list of words. Five drugs are now approved by FDA of which Avonex has demonstrated to be the most positive benefit on cognition. However, none of the medications have shown dramatic benefits, on slowing the progression of cognitive dysfunctions or reversing the effects.",

Multiple sclerosis is a disease which can target any part of the nervous system like if it affects the nerves servicing the reproductive organs, which in turn could lead to changes in sexual functioning. Multiple sclerosis can cause problems for the patients on two aspects: neurologically and psychologically. Neurologically, the sexual excitement and response arises in the central nervous system which is normally affected. While the brain sends messages to the sex organs through spinal cord but due to multiple sclerosis the affected area is the nerve pathways which is caused by demyelination. This can cause impairment in sexual functioning like:",

By 1850s, these boys grew progressively weaker, unable to walk & later on died at an early age and made a marked impression on medical field. Later in 19th century French neurologist Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne did pioneering work & gave a comprehensive account of 13 boys with the most common and severe form of the disease( which now carries his name-Duchenne muscular dystrophy) & revealed of the disease having more than one form, and that these diseases are affected in people of either sex and of all ages. Duchenne was the first to do a biopsy to obtain tissue from a living patient for microscopic examination & used his biopsy needle on boys with DMD and concluded to have this disease of muscle origin.",

Children of either sex can be affected by this pattern of inheritance.\n\nX-linked (or sex-linked) recessive inheritance occurs when a mother carries the affected gene on one of her two X chromosomes and passes it to her son (males always inherit an X chromosome from their mother and a Y chromosome from their father, while daughters inherit an X chromosome from each parent). Sons of carrier mothers have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the disorder. Daughters also have a 50 percent chance of inheriting the defective gene but usually are not affected, since the healthy X chromosome they receive from their father can offset the faulty one received from their mother. Affected fathers cannot pass an X-linked disorder to their sons but their daughters will be carriers of that disorder. Carrier females occasionally can exhibit milder symptoms of MD.",

People with myotonic MD has long life expectancy, with variable but slowly progressive disability. Onset of disease is seen between ages 20 and 30, but can develop earlier. Myotonic MD affects the central nervous system and other body systems, including the heart, adrenal glands and thyroid, eyes, and gastrointestinal tract. Muscles in the face and the front of the neck are the first to show weakness and may produce a haggard, \"hatchet\" face and a thin, swan-like neck. Wasting and weakness can be apprecipated in forearm muscles with other symptoms including cardiac complications, difficulty swallowing, ptosis, cataracts, poor vision, early frontal baldness, weight loss, impotence, testicular atrophy, mild mental impairment, and increased sweating.

Sensory NCSs are normal and Motor NCSs have normal latencies,conduction velocities and F-wave latencies, but amplitude of compound muscle action potential (CMAP) decreases as disease progresses. Repetitive stimulation studies involve electrically stimulating a nerve 5 to 10 times, at a frequency of 2-3 shocks per second, to study muscle function.\n\nMedical Management: There is no specific treatment that can stop or reverse the progression of any form of MD. All forms of MD are genetic and cannot be prevented. Treatment is aimed at keeping the patient independent for as long as possible and preventing complications that result from weakness, reduced mobility, and cardiac and respiratory difficulties. Treatment may involve a combination of approaches, including physical therapy, drug therapy, and surgery. Assisted ventilation is required to treat respiratory muscle weakness especially seen in the later stages. Oxygen is fed through a flexible mask to keep the lungs inflate fully. some patients may need overnight ventilation when respiration becomes more strenuous. A mask worn over the face is connected by tube to a machine that puts out intermittent bursts of forced oxygen. Obese patients with Duchenne MD may develop obstructive sleep apnea and require nighttime ventilation. Patients on a ventilator may also require the use of a gastric feeding tube. Drug therapy may be prescribed to delay muscle degeneration.",

A profiling bed may be useful as part of a postural management positioning programme. Profiling beds also allow the height of the bed from the floor to be adjusted. Caretakers will also find the ability to raise the bed to an optimum-working height invaluable for transfers, helping with dressing, carrying out stretches or helping the young person to move. The risk of back strain is then minimised. Occupational therapists can provide advice regarding the number of transfers required and can also advise on how to eliminate unnecessary moves.

They present with symptoms related to focal muscle weakness where the symptoms may start either distally or proximally in the upper limbs and lower limbs. Patients may\n\nhave noticed fasciculations (noticed as involuntary muscle twitching) or cramps preceding the onset of weakness or wasting for some months (or years). The weakness is usually of insidious onset, and patients may notice that symptoms are exacerbated by cold weather.

Power of finger flexion is also seriously impaired in the presence of wrist drop, and is aided by application of a static wrist extension splint. Foot drop due to weakness of the long toe extensor muscles may be aided by a suitable splint. In mildly affected cases a lightweight slipper type of appliance, extending up the calf of the leg and fitting inside the shoe, may be adequate. Lightweight boots are preferable to shoes because of the added ankle stability. Later, a more sturdy external appliance with toe-spring attached t o the shoe or boot proves necessary, often with an external below-knee caliper. Weakness of the quadriceps muscles causing sudden instability of the knees in walking may be aided by a long-leg caliper with knee-locking device. A cervical collar, Sometimes with suitable chest plate support, is frequently necessary for paravertebral muscle paresis and flopping of the head onto the chest. Lower limb appliances may be used in conjunction with a walking stick or crutches, depending on the degree of disability. Eventually a wheelchair proves necessary, especially for outdoor excursions. A suitable folding chair which is easily stowed in a car is preferable for outdoor use.

The stress-buffering model explains that stress, such as that linked with a chronic or terminal illness can be appreciably moderated by good social support.

Also, as the family and spouse are completely involved in taking care of the needs of the patient, right from visiting doctors, to therapy sessions to day - to - day work, patients might lose a lover or companion. Patients might experience increasing isolation from friends, family and socializing, which is what is known as \"social disability\" [6]. Some patients either withdraw from others as they see their own mortality and are very scared, where as others prefer to live in \"social vacuum\". Social support is very helpful and acts as a protection from depression which is associated with low social support, withdrawal and feeling of being bounded at home.

There are many studies which report that patients who have a positive effort to confront problems are at a lower risk to experience anxiety and depression.

The major reductions in the deaths from GBS over the past few decades have been due to advances in supportive care, particularly in mechanical ventilation. Respiratory compromise is the most common serious complication and underlines the reason that approximately 30% of GBS patients who are hospitalized require treatment in an ICU. Weakness of the respiratory muscles, particularly the diaphragm, is most often responsible for respiratory failure. Other factors include weakness of various bulbar-innervated muscles and pulmonary complications, including atelectasis, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolism. Vital capacity measurements provide the most useful information regarding the degree of respiratory compromise. Respiratory function may be monitored closely. Intratracheal intubation is complicated in patients with GBS because of dysautonomia, which can result in marked hypotension, arrhythmias, and sudden death due to various drugs and to airway manipulation and because of hyperkalemia, induced by succinylcholine, which can cause arrhythmias and cardiac arrest. Dysautonomia occurs to some extent in majority of GBS patients but more frequently and more severely in those with respiratory failure and severe motor deficits. Pulmonary embolism may occur in about 5% of patients immobilized with GBS, typically after the second week of immobilization.

The facial palsy associated with Ramsay-Hunt syndrome is more severe and has a lower recovery rate than that of Bell palsy. The diagnosis of Ramsay-Hunt syndrome is relatively easy in the presence of typical skin rash.. A combination of acyclovir (4000 mg daily for 5 days) and prednisone (60 mg/day for 4 days) provide a 100% cure rate if started within 3 days after the onset.",

Paresis generally affects distal muscles, with loss of the ability to perform fractionated movements of the digits. The upper motor neuron syndrome results from damage to descending motor pathways at cortical, brainstem, or spinal cord levels and spasticity evolves in the days and weeks after injury. When the injury that leads to spasticity is acute, muscle tone is flaccid with hyporeflexia before the appearance of spasticity.

These spinal reflexes include stretch, flexor and extensor reflexes and are under supraspinal control by inhibitory and excitatory descending pathways. Stretch reflexes are proprioceptive reflexes, and are either phasic or tonic. The tonic stretch reflex arises from a sustained muscle stretch and is the cause of spasticity (Sheean 2002). Stretch reflex is dependent on tendon lengthening and excitatory post synaptic potentials (EPSPs) carried by I-a afferents but Inhibitory post synaptic potentials (IPSPs) arising from antagonistic muscle spindles, oligosynaptic and polysynaptic pathways also have an important role in the maintenance of tone (Lance 1980, Young 1994, Nathan 1973).",

Selective damage to area 4 in the cerebral cortex of primates produces paresis that improves with time, but increases in muscle tone are not a prominent feature. Lesions involving area 6 cause impairment of postural control in the contralateral limbs. Combined lesions of areas 4 and 6 cause both paresis and spasticity to develop.[3] Physiologic evidence suggests interruption of reticulospinal projections is important in the genesis of spasticity.[4] In spinal cord lesions, bilateral damage to the pyramidal and reticulospinal pathways can produce severe spasticity and flexor spasms, reflecting increased tone in flexor muscle groups and weakness of extensor muscles.4",

This occurs in the absence of phasic stretch and is sensitive to the degree of tonic stretch of the co-contracting antagonist (Gracies et al. 1997). For instance, triceps will be recruited during volitional action of biceps and will lead to elbow stiffness Associated reactions are found in muscles that are not particularly stretch sensitive.

This hypertonia is velocity-dependent, with faster stretching velocities being associated with greater amounts of reflex activity. The development of tonic stretch reflex hyperexcitability could be due to a lower threshold, an increased gain of the stretch reflex, or a combination of the two. The resultant increase in muscle tone is thought to be due to a combination increased denervation hypersensitivity and changed muscle properties.11, Denervation leads to an initial downregulation of neuronal membrane receptors, followed by an upregulation, with enhanced sensitivity to neurotransmitters.2 Gradual changes in muscle properties also occur following SCI, such as fibrosis, atrophy of muscle fibers, decrease in the elastic properties, decrease in the number of sarcomeres, accumulation of connective tissue, and alteration of contractile properties toward tonic muscle characteristics, which likely contribute to the increased passive tension.11,",

Some patients early on after their stroke or brain injury are helped by their spasticity. For example, patients may start to support their weight by using their spastic lower limb when the degree of weakness in the leg would not allow it. Physical management (good nursing care, physiotherapy, occupational therapy) through postural management, exercise, stretching and strengthening of limbs, splinting and pain relief is the basis of spasticity management (British Society of Rehabilitation Medicine 1992). The aim of treatment is to reduce abnormal sensory inputs, in order to decrease excessive a-motor neuron activity (Ward 1999). All pharmacological interventions are adjunctive to a programme of physical intervention. Stretching plays an important part in physical management, but needs to be applied for several hours per day (Tardieu et al. 1998). Limb casting has been developed in this field to provide a prolonged stretch. Some studies have suggested that task-specific training might be more effective (Socialstyrelsen 2006).",

Where there is no movement, the assessment process is fairly straightforward, but where there is loss of motor control rather than a spastic dystonia, one has to attempt to identify the different aspects of motor impairment.

The clinicians and the patient/carer can then know what anti- spastic treatment can or cannot achieve and realistic expectations can then be identified. Severe, inadequately treated spasticity will go on to develop a limb contracture through shortening the muscle and tendons. A contracture may be fixed and will require serial splinting or surgery to correct it, but before it becomes fixed, the spasticity contributes to a dynamic contracture and treating the underlying spasticity may allow easier treatment of the contracture. One way to do that is examination under sedation. It is advisable to use a general anaesthetic for children. This relaxes spastic muscles and allows the range of passive joint movement to be assessed. One particular use is in assessing patients, who externally rotate their leg during walking. The adductor muscles can compensate for weak hip flexors and the patient rotates the leg accordingly. Blocking the obturator nerve reduces the function of the adductors and it is then possible to see the degree of hip flexor weakness, so that a programme of muscle strengthening can be started rather than of BTX injections to weaken the adductors.",

Injections should be targeted to spastic muscles responsible to functional loss using EMG guidance. 35 The effect of botulinum toxin starts within two weeks after injection. The clinical effect appears 4-7 days after injection, reaches a maximum after about 2 months thereafter the effect tapers off. The effect of botulinum toxin is not permanent and lasts for 3-4 months. After 3-4 months the effect gradually fades away and repeat treatment may be required depending on the symptoms/ dysfunction caused by spasticity.

Sometimes, inhibitive casts will be used to \"give more information\" (proprioception) to the ankle joint or the foot in order to prevent a child from using \"reflex patterns\" of movement. They are often utilized when a child with muscle imbalance is learning to walk. They can give better proprioceptive input to the foot when compared to the AFO since they are heavier and can have special features built in to them. For example, inhibitive foot plates can be built into the base of each cast. The inhibitive foot plates apply pressure to different areas of the foot to give better proprioceptive input to the joint which inhibits reflex patterns of movement. Often times, we will use inhibitive casts prior to prescribing orthotics, depending on a child's function.",

The beneficial effect of casting on hypertonia is well documented in literature71,72,73. Serial casting is effective in presence of a contracture and its use should cease when desired position is achieved and tone is manageable using a splint.\n\nMultiple commercially available spasticity reducing splints are used to keep hand and wrists in inhibitive postures. The client and family need to be educated in continuing to incorporate the extremities in occupations and to bear weight on extremities as much as possible; to retain the ROM gain achieved during casting 74",

In order to incorporate the hand into FTM arm training, a dynamic orthosis for the hand called the SaeboFlex is used. This orthosis assists an individual who exhibits hypertonia in the hand to place the hand in an open functional position and also to produce a graded muscle contraction of the finger flexors in order to grasp an object. The FTM program combines high repetition grasp and release with task specific arm training drills to progress the client towards a functional goal. A significant body of research support the FTM arm training program 26, 27, 28. Clinically observed improvements with FTM arm training Program include increased AROM at the shoulder, elbow and wrist, improved upper extremity Fugal- Meyers Scores and decreased modified Ashworth Scores78.",

Most orthoses have employed lightweight thermoplastic materials, which are plastics that become pliable when they are heated and retain their shape once they cool. The thermoplastic sheets can be molded to fit body parts exactly, and some can be reshaped repeatedly as the treated body part changes shape. The resulting orthotic device is lightweight and relatively easy to use and maintain.",

For this reason, a wide variety of upper limb orthoses have come into existence. These devices often go by multiple names, reflecting the name of the manufacturer, the name of the person who developed the device, or the anatomy and function it serves.\n\nIn the 1970s, a group of American professionals involved in the field of orthotics-put forth an effort to classify orthoses by their function and acronyms describing the joints that are encumbered by the orthoses. From this effort sprung the current nomenclature : AFO- ankle foot orthosis, TLSO- thoracolumbosacral orthosis, WHO- wrist hand orthosis, etc. However, the nomenclature based on the function of the orthosis; such as assist dorsiflexion at ankle, limit wrist flexion to 10 degrees, resist thoracolumbar rotation has not found wide spread acceptance.",

Dynamic orthoses are useful for patients who have weakened muscles or limited neuromuscular control, because they allow the patient to perform actions that would be difficult or impossible without assistance. These devices promote independence in patients who have handicapping conditions, and they are common in rehabilitation settings. Since no single device can perform all the movements that the human hand can perform, the patient may need to use several different dynamic devices in order to carry out activities of daily living.

Since most upper limb orthoses are removable, patients can choose whether or not to use these devices.

Health care professionals must work closely with the patient to ensure that the patient will accept the orthosis and use it properly.\n\nExercise: Splints and exercises must be carefully integrated to allow the patients to achieve their full rehabilitation potential. Splints are used to improve passive motion, substitute for weakened or lack of active motion and are infrequently fabricated to provide resistive exercise. Evaluation measures provide the guidelines from which splinting and exercise programs are coordinated. Because patients with identical diagnosis may respond differently to therapeutic interventions, it is insufficient and often detrimental to adhere to rigid pre determined protocols and the exercise and splinting programs will require constant alterations to keep pace with the changing requirements. Patients are generally instructed to repeat a splint wearing and exercise routine every two hourly through out the day. This involves wearing the splint for one hour and forty five minutes and then removing the splint and exercising for 15 minutes. Conversely if stiffness is a problem, exercise may be prescribed more often.for e.g. every 45 minutes. Written instructions for splint wearing and exercise routine should be used to augment verbal instructions.",

There is a lengthy debate on the theoretical basis for splinting within neurology with two conflicting theories of biomechanical and neurophysiological approaches (Copley and Kuipers, 1999). Biomechanical rationale argues that splinting is used to prevent and manage length-associated changes in muscles and connective tissues. The neurophysiological rationale recommends that splinting is used to inhibit reflexive contracture of the muscle. The decision on whether to splint must be made on sound clinical reasoning.

In 2007, Lannin et al. conducted a randomised control trial and found no evidence to support the provision of a splint to prevent contracture in the acute phase for spasticity as a method of prevention of contracture. Regular passive range of movement and stretching is recommended and it is important to provide teaching to the patient and carer to perform this programme. The type of splint chosen will vary depending on the ideal position, but may include cones or resting splints in volar, dorsal or mid prone.",

The new and wide variety of thermoplastic materials available to fabricate customized orthotics provides many options for upper and lower extremities as well as for trunk. The least restrictive devices, soft splints can be constructed from webbing, neoprene, hook and loop fastener material and other substances. Soft splints do not limit dynamic mobility and sensory feedback as much as do thermoplastics. For children with moderate degree of spasticity stronger moulded thermoplastic materials are necessary to provide stability. They are lighter in weight than the original metal and leather braces and are easily cleaned. Some of the low temperature plastics can be altered as growth or change occurs. OT have found that upper extremity casting which provides prolonged and gentle stretch to spastic or contracted muscles is an effective adjunct to therapeutic techniques. Results of upper extremity casting have been significant with increased strength, control, and spontaneous use of impaired arm as well as bilateral hand use during play and transitional movements. The casting program is always integrated into the therapy program with the same functional goals.",

Reinforcements: The use of a reward or reinforcement can encourage behavior change, enhance learning and solidify gains.

Group psychotherapy, individual psychotherapy, is intended to help people who would like to improve their ability to cope with difficulties and problems in their lives. But, while in individual therapy the patient meets with only one person (the therapist), in group therapy the meeting is with a whole group and one or two therapists.

Groups are ideally suited to people who are struggling with relationship issues, disability, caregiving, etc. The groups interactions help the participants to identify, get feedback, and change the patterns that are sabotaging the relations.

Human beings communicate through various modes or channels called modalities. The most commonly used modality to communicate is verbal modality or spoken modality. Speech is a result of co-ordination between different systems in the body namely respiration, phonation, resonance and articulation. The organs which actively participate in speech production are the lungs, the larynx (voice box), the vocal tract, the lips, the tongue, the soft palate and all the sinuses. Also, hearing is an important sensory organ which has direct connection to speech production and perception. An audiologist and speech language pathologist is a professional who deals with diagnosis and treatment of disorders related to speech and hearing.",

When transplanted into injured tissue, the stem cell faces a hostile, nutrient-deficient, inflammatory environment and may release substances which limit local inflammation in order to enhance its survival. Modulation of local tissue levels of pro- inflammatory cytokines by anti-inflammatory paracrine factors released by stem cells (such as IL- 10 and TGF-?) is important in conferring improved outcome after stem cell therapy.

With similar motion, the needle is inserted till it penetrates the cortex. At this point initially a sudden giving way of the resistance is felt as the needle enters the soft trabecular bone and then the needle feels firmly fixed in the bone. The angle of insertion of the needle is important as it has to be in alignment with the curve of the bone. If this is not done properly the needle will make a through and through penetration across both the cortical surfaces with the tip now being outside the marrow.

Fast Fibers:\n\nMost of the skeletal muscle fibers in the body are called fast fibers, because they can contract\n\nin 0.01 sec or less after stimulation. Fast fibers are large in diameter; they contain densely packed mofibrils, large glycogen reserves, and relatively few mitochondria. The tension produced by a muscle fiber is directly proportional to the number of sarcomeres, so muscles dominated by fast fibers produce powerful contractions. However, fast fibers fatigue rapidly because their contractions use ATP in massive amounts, so prolonged activity is supported primarily by anaerobic metabolism. Several other names are used to",

Slow Fibers:\n\nSlow Fibres are only about half the diameter of fast fibers and take three times as long to contract after stimulation. Slow fibers are specialized to enable them to continue contracting for extended periods, long after a fast muscle would have become fatigued. The most important specializations in them is improved mitochondrial performance. Slow muscle tissue contains more extensive network of capillaries than in a typical fast muscle tissue and so has a dramatically higher oxygen supply. In addition, slow fibers contain the red pigment myoglobin . This globular protein is structurally related to hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying pigment in blood. Both myoglobin and hemoglobin are red pigments that reversibly bind oxygen molecules. Although other muscle fiber types contain small amounts of myoglobin, it is most abundant in slow fibers. As a result, resting slow fibers contain substantial oxygen reserves that can be mobilized during a contraction. Because slow fibers have both an extensive capillary supply and a high concentration of myoglobin, skeletal muscles dominated by slow fibers are dark red. They are also known as red muscle fibers, slow-twitch oxidative fibers, and Type I fibers.",

In appearance, intermediate fibers most closely resemble fast fibers, for they contain little myoglobin and are relatively pale. They have a more extensive capillary network around them, however, and are more resistant to fatigue than are fast fibers. Intermediate fibers are also known as fast- twitch oxidative fibers and Type II-B fibers.\n\nMUSCLE PHYSIOLOGY\n\nSarcomere is the contractile unit of a myofibril, which are repeating units and delimited by the Z bands along the length of the myofibril.\n\nMuscle units are separated from other muscle groups by plasma membranes called the sarcolemma and the cytoplasm within is called the sarcoplasm. Within the sarcoplasm are multiple long protein bundles called myofibrils, and many ATP producing mitochondria, as well as glycogen (a form of stored glucose for energy) and myoglobin (oxygen stored in blood for the breakdown of glycogen). Bundles of parallel myofilaments make up the myofibrils which is where most of the action takes place. In the myofilaments are contractile proteins called myosin (thick filaments), and actin (thin filaments).When signaled, the actin and myosin interlock and slide over each other to stretch or slide into one another to contraction. They are signaled from the nervous system followed by a series of chemical reactions involving ATP, calcium, sodium and potassium ions.",

On the muscle fiber the 'I band' is the space between the myosin (thick) filaments, where lies only the thin filaments. In the middle of each 'I band' is a dark disc called the 'Z disc' made of titan, (elastic filament), which is connected to the sarcolemma by the cytoskeleton. The space between each Z disc, where these filaments interact, is called the sarcomere. As the muscle contracts the 'I band\" shrinks and the sarcomere shortens and as the Z disc's come closer",

A faradic current is a short -duration interrupted direct current with a pulse duration of 0.1 - 1 ms & a frequency of 50 - 100 Hz. Strength of contraction depends on the number of motor units activated which in turn depends on the intensity of the current applied & the rate of change of current. To delay fatigue of muscle due to repeated contractions, current is commonly surged to allow for muscle relaxation.",
