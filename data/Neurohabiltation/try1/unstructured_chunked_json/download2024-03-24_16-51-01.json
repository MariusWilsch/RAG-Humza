    "text": "ABSTRACT\n\nBackground: Neurological rehabilitation and the contribution of physical therapy have changed considerably over the past decades as scientific and technological developments have enabled greater understanding of brain reorganization and the mechanisms of motor control, motor performance, impairments and adaptations. Objective: This paper presents a historical perspective covering the last half-century. Discussion: Current scientific research, and the subsequent reevaluation of the functional effects of impairments following an upper motor neuron lesion, is leading to a changing focus in clinical interventions, with emphasis on optimizing motor performance through task-oriented exercise and training, strength and fitness training. Findings in both animal and human models suggest that, for rehabilitation to be effective in optimizing neural reorganization and functional recovery, increased emphasis needs to be placed on challenging, engaging and meaningful task training, to promote learning. The issues of the intensity of task training and extent of cardiovascular stress during physical activity are also discussed. Although there is much to become excited about in the findings from clinical research, clinical practice in neurorehabilitation continues to vary widely and depends largely on the preferred approach of the individual therapist and on the continuing dominance of therapeutic methods developed half a century ago. Physiotherapists need to embrace the respon- sibility of using evidence-based, or at least scientifically acceptable, methods of intervention and objective measurements of outcome.",

The history of neurological physical therapy exemplifies the process of change. Practitioners early in the 20th century used forms of corrective exercise and muscle re-education, the latter involving exercises directed at individual muscles, with consideration of the roles of synergistic muscles. The knowledge that clinicians applied in their practice reflected an early focus on structural anatomy and principles of exercise as understood at the time. Many of those receiving physical therapy were individuals with muscle weakness and paralysis from poliomyelitis. This emphasis was to shift as the numbers of people acquiring poliomyelitis gradually declined with new preventive therapies and, following the second world war, an influx of young adults with acute brain injury helped drive the development of new therapies.",

These developments took advantage of experimental work that focused on how humans acquire skill in movement or motor learning6,7, on muscle biology and muscle adaptability8,9, and on psychology10. These developments reflected to a large extent the increasing opportunity for physiotherapists to enroll in postgraduate courses, thereby developing research skills and engaging in intensive study of specific scientific fields.

    "text": "Origins of the neurofacilitation approaches\n\nIn the 1950s, a major conceptual shift in neurological physical therapy was evident as the neurophysiological or neurofacilitation approaches were developed. The focus changed from the muscle to non-muscle elements. Methods were directed primarily at the nervous system with movement facilitated by stimulation of the nervous system. Major influences were the work of the Bobaths1,2, in Bobath Therapy or Neurodevelopmental Therapy (NDT), and of Kabat, Knott and Voss3, whose methods of movement facilitation were referred to as Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation (PNF). Other therapists also developed their ideas for therapy around this time, including Rood, Ayres and Brunnstrom. These approaches to therapy are often referred to as eponymous as they were named after their originators4. Although the originators had different and sometimes conflicting approaches, their methods reflected their interpretations of early neurophysiological writings with experimental paradigms including stimulus-response mechanisms, many of them based on animal models. Therapeutic methods focused on facilitating movement by afferent stimulation, specifically of muscle and joint proprioceptors and tactile receptors. Their methods were based on ideas of the restorative effects of encouraging developmental movement patterns, and emphasized postural stability and normal movement patterns. The Bobaths held the view that the normalizing of muscle tone by methods of inhibiting spasticity (abnormal postural tone) should take place before more normal movement could be facilitated. They held the view that movements requiring effort would increase",

    "text": "The early attempts at developing therapy methods to improve functional movement were largely inductive (seeking a theoretical explanation for observed events), and this may have been partly due to the lack of a relevant scientific body of knowledge on human movement from which clinical implications could be more deductively derived. Over the last few decades, however, technological developments together with changes in the conceptualization of how the human nervous system might function to produce skilled movement, have been producing an increasing volume of movement-related research, in the fields of biomechanics and neuroscience in particular, that has obvious relevance to clinical practice. Experimental paradigms have shifted from a reductionist approach, in which the focus was, for example, on stretch reflex mechanisms using animal models, to an exploration of mechanisms of movement control in humans from the perspectives of performance as well as of physiological mechanisms. Technological developments in motion analysis and electromyography (EMG) have enabled studies of actions such as walking, standing up and reaching to pick up an object that demonstrate the kinematics and kinetics of each action, including the specific postural adjustments. New brain imaging methods are enabling an examination of organizational changes occurring within the brain itself and of the experiences that might drive them, particularly the effects of patterns of use and learning.",

Soft tissue adaptations include increased muscle stiffness (stiffness is a mechanical response to load on a non-contracting muscle), and structural and functional reorganization of muscle and connective tissue17,18. Muscle weakness arises from two sources, primarily from the lesion itself as a result of a decrease in descending inputs converging on the final motor neuron population and a resultant reduction in the number of motor units available for recruitment19. In addition, the neural lesion can result in a decreased firing rate of motor units and impaired motor unit synchronization20. These factors cause disorganization of voluntary motor output at the segmental level and may underlie the motor control problems exhibited by patients even when they are able to generate some muscle force14. Loss of the ability to generate power (force X velocity) may be a more significant cause of impaired motor performance than decreased force production21. The ability to generate large muscle forces is of little functional benefit if movement occurs too slowly to be effective5. Power output after stroke has been shown to be low in a number of studies21-23, and a low velocity of muscle contraction is evident clinically in the slowness of movement typical of people after stroke12.",

A re-evaluation of the relative contributions of muscle weakness and adaptive changes in muscles such as increased stiffness and spasticity is driving significant changes in clinical practice. The view that spasticity is the major impairment underlying movement dysfunction led to the development of methods based on the premise that spasticity had to be decreased or inhibited in order to facilitate more normal movement1,2. This view has been very influential over the past few decades. Muscle weakness has not been a primary focus in physical therapy until recently, as spasticity was considered the cause of weakness and disability. Congruent with this view, therapists have avoided exercise that required effort (as in strength training) since this effort was assumed to increase spasticity.",

Increasingly, evidence is provided of a relationship between muscle strength and function26-28.\n\nThe significance of spasticity (defined as velocity- dependent stretch reflex hyperactivity29) for the regaining of motor function remains equivocal. There is little to support the view that reflex hyperactivity is a significant contributor to movement dysfunction after stroke. Some reports indicate stretch reflex hyperactivity can develop some time after the lesion, suggesting that it may be an adaptive response to non- functional, contracted stiff muscles30. In clinical practice, increased resistance to passive movement is typically referred to as spasticity although mechanical and functional changes to muscle are likely to be major contributors. Clinical tests such as the Ashworth Scale that are commonly used in clinical research are unable to distinguish the relative contributions of increased stiffness of muscles and reflex hyperactivity 31.",

One point of interest is that the focus is strongly on the importation of theories and data from fields other than physical therapy, illustrating the nature of physical therapy as an applied clinical science.\n\nOur work over the past few decades has focused on the patient as learner and on the need for task-oriented exercise and training, together with strength and fitness training, as the means of improving the patient\u2019s capacity to learn motor skills and optimize functional motor performance. An increasing number of investigations of this theoretical perspective have found positive effects in individuals with brain lesions. Improved functional performance suggests that learning has taken place27,33-44. In addition, training that is sufficiently intensive can increase muscle endurance and produce a cardiovascular training effect. Where strength has been particularly targeted, findings show increased strength and, in some cases, improved functional performance. Whether or not strength training results in improved function may, however, depend on the extent of muscle weakness. Interestingly, strength training does not result in increased resistance to passive movement (hypertonus) or reflex hyperactivity (spasticity).",

Load on the musculoskeletal system can be increased or decreased by varying body weight support (BWS), and walking speed can be controlled. TT facilitates the cyclic gait pattern and can induce a shift toward temporal symmetry and increased paretic stance time46.

It is not only important for patients to practice in order to regain skill in performing actions, but it is also critical that they regain sufficient strength, endurance and fitness to be able to carry out these actions. It is well documented that stroke patients have low physical endurance when discharged from rehabilitation. Deconditioning can occur within the first six weeks after stroke. In a study that measured exercise capacity in the early post-stroke period, patients performed incremental maximal effort tests on a semi-recumbent cycle ergometer76.
